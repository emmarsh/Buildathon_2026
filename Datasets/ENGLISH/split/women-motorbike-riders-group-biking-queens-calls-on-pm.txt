A group of 50 women motorbike riders from Gujarat – the Biking Queens – today called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi.
The group says they have driven over 10,000 km, covering 13 States/UTs, and interacted with people on social themes, such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao; and Swachh Bharat.
On 15th August, 2017, they unfurled the tricolour at Khardungla, in Ladakh.
The Prime Minister appreciated their efforts and wished them the best for their future endeavours.
