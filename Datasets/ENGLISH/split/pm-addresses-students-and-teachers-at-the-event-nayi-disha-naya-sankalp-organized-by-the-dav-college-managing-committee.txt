Speaking on the occasion, he said that Swami Dayananda, continues to inspire even today.
He said that the Arya Samaj, which was founded in the backdrop of the 1857 uprising for Independence, fought against superstition, and has been a force for reform.
The Prime Minister said that the Naya Sankalp – new resolve – should be to raise India’s stature globally.
This, he said, would be true homage to Swami Dayananda.
He said that with DAV’s huge strength of students and alumni, if they resolve to work on certain issues, they can together achieve significant results in a short span of time.
He said the attempt should always be to create a modern and scientific India of the 21st century.
The Prime Minister noted that the DAV College Management Committee had offered to support his Clean Ganga initiative.
Welcoming this, the Prime Minister said that this was an initiative that could only succeed through people’s involvement.
The Prime Minister also spoke of various Government initiatives for the benefit of the youth, such as Mudra Yojana, Start-Up India and Skill Development.
