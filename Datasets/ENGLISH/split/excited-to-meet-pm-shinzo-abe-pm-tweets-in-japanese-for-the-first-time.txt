The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has tweeted in Japanese for the first time, to talk to the people of Japan directly in Japanese.
A team of Japanese volunteers helped with the translation.
Following is the English translation of the tweets:-
“On 30th August I will begin my visit to Japan.
I am keenly looking forward to the visit, which will boost relations between our two Nations.
Japan visit will be my 1st bilateral visit outside the subcontinent.
I was to visit in early July but could not due to Parliament session.
I see the Japan visit as an opportunity to take our ties with Japan to a new level and increase cooperation in various fields.
I will visit Tokyo and Kyoto and will interact with all sections of Japanese society from students, political leaders to captains of industry.
Have very warm memories of visiting Japan as a CM.
The hospitality and the immense scope for cooperation left a deep impression in my mind.
The scale of innovation and level of precision among the people of Japan is admirable.
Both our Nations can learn a lot from each other.
Am particularly excited to meet PM Abe.
I deeply respect his leadership & enjoy a warm relationship with him from previous meetings.
Japan’s friendship with India is time tested.
We are two vibrant democracies committed to advancing peace and prosperity in the world.”
