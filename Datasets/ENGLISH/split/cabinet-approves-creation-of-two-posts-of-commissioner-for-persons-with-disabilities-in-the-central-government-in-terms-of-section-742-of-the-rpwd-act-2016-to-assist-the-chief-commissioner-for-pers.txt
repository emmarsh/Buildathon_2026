The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for Creation of two (2) posts of Commissioners in the Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), in terms of provisions of The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016.
Out of the two posts of Commissioners, one Commissioner will be a person with disability.
The above two Commissioners will assist the CCPD in discharging his statutory functions as per provisions of the said Act.
This would enable the Office of CCPD to look into the complaints of persons with disabilities expeditiously, besides strengthening the monitoring mechanism overseeing the implementation of the RPwD Act, 2016.
