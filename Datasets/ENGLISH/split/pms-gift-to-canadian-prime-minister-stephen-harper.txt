Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today gifted Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Stephen Harper, a miniature painting titled Guru Nanak Dev.
Painted in the traditional Indian miniature style, this composition shows Guru Nanak Dev with his two disciples Bhai Mardana and Bhai Bala, sitting beside him.
The background of pristine landscape adds to the tranquility around the painting encased in intricately painted borders.
Painted on handmade paper with mineral colours, the work has been done by a Jaipur-based artist, Virendra Bannu, who is a seventh generation artist in his family and has been taking forward the legacy of his family in specialized miniature art form.
The Prime Minister said, “So many of our Punjabi brothers and sisters have made Canada their home and enriched it with their renowned vigour and entrepreneurial drive.”
