“To all those saying #ThankYouPM- appreciate the sentiment…real thanks should be to our great culture, which teaches us ‘Seva Parmo Dharma’.
If we want to thank anyone, it should be the 125 crore people of India who have made Nepal’s pain their own and extended all help.
We must thank our armed forces, NDRF teams, doctors and all those volunteers who are overcoming every obstacle to restore normalcy in Nepal.
We owe a big thanks to the enthusiastic youngsters who are mobilising contributions for relief work be it cash, resources and medicines etc.
Mention must be made of the media.
They are bravely covering the disaster from the ground.
Thanks!
The immense co-operation between Centre and the States is a major asset in times like these.
A big thanks to all State Governments.
And above all, we salute the resilience of our sisters and brothers in Nepal and parts of India, for their courage in the face of disaster,” the Prime Minister said.
