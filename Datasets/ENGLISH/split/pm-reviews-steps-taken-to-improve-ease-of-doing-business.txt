India’s rise in the World Bank “Doing Business” rankings from 142 to 77, over the last four years, was taken note of.
Officials explained the steps being taken to plug shortcomings and resolve bottlenecks in implementing business reforms.
The Prime Minister stressed on the need to improve last mile delivery, and focus on streamlining procedures, which would improve not just the “Doing Business” rankings, but also increase the “Ease of Living” for small businesses and the common man.
