The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Faculty Exchange Agreement signed between the National Defence College, New Delhi and National Defence College, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
The objective of the Agreement is to institutionalize regular exchange programs and establish sustainable mechanisms between the two National Defence Colleges with an aim to enhancing mutual cooperation in the field of national security, development and strategic studies.
Given the geographical and cultural closeness between the two countries, there are many common challenges like countering terrorism that needs joint action.
Hence, there is a need for better coordination and cooperation among the armed forces.
The exchange of faculty members of the premier institutes will help to bring symmetry in the capacities of the armed forces and contribute to countering and managing common threats and challenges much better.
The Agreement establishes the framework for enhanced cooperation in the field of military education concerning strategic and operational studies.
