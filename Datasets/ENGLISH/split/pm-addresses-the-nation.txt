The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the nation today.
In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister said “In the journey of every nation there are moments that bring utmost pride and have a historic impact on generations to come.
One such moment is today.
India has successfully tested the Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile.
Congratulations to everyone on the success of Mission Shakti.
Mission Shakti was a highly complex one, conducted at extremely high speed with remarkable precision.
It shows the remarkable dexterity of India’s outstanding scientists and the success of our space programme.
Mission Shakti is special for 2 reasons:
(1) India is only the 4th country to acquire such a specialised & modern capability.
(2) Entire effort is indigenous.
India stands tall as a space power!
It will make India stronger, even more secure and will further peace and harmony.”
