PM: Had we followed Swami Ji’s message, history would never have witnessed such dastardly acts as the 9/11 terror attack.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has recalled Swami Vivekananda’s message of universal brotherhood, delivered in his soul-stirring address at World Parliament of Religions in Chicago on 11th September 1893.
“Through his address, Swami Vivekananda drew the entire world’s attention to our Nation’s rich history and strong cultural roots,” the Prime Minister said.
“”Sisters and brothers of America”…with these words of Swami Vivekananda, India’s message of universal brotherhood reverberated across the world,” Shri Narendra Modi said.
“There are 2 images of 11th September – one of the trail of destruction in 2001 and the other – the message of Swami Vivekananda in 1893.
Had we followed Swami Ji’s message, history would never have witnessed such dastardly acts as we saw on 11th September 2001 in USA,” the Prime Minister said.
“Let us remember the words of Swami Vivekananda and dedicate ourselves to furthering the cause of unity, brotherhood and world peace,” the Prime Minister said.
