The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the modifications in the policy for liberalisation of administratively allotted spectrum where market determined prices were not available.
This will facilitate optimal utilisation of spectrum by introducing new technologies, sharing and trading of spectrum.
The most recent recommended reserve price will be taken as the provisional price for liberalisation of administratively allocated spectrum where auction determined price is not available.
Subsequent to the completion of the ensuing auction and with the availability of auction determined price, the provisional price already charged will be adjusted with the auction determined price with effect from the date of liberalisation on pro-rata basis.
This decision was taken on the basis of the recommendations of the sector regulator, TRAI and approximately and a sum of Rs.1300 crore is likely to accrue by this process.
