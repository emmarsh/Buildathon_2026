Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met Shri Balwant Kumawat, a youth from Bhilwara, Rajasthan.
Shri Kumawat had expressed a keen desire that Shri Narendra Modi become Prime Minister.
Two years ago, he had even taken a pledge not to wear footwear until he meets “Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.”
He was barefoot continuously since then.
After his meeting with the Prime Minister, Shri Kumawat resumed wearing footwear.
The Prime Minister advised Shri Kumawat to now devote his energies to a positive cause for Nation-building.
He also urged Shri Kumawat not to take a pledge which would cause physical discomfort.
