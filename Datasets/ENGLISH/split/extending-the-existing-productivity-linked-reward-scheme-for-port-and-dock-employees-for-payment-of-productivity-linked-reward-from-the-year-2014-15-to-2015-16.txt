The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for extending the existing Productivity Linked Reward (PLR) Scheme for Port and Dock employees for payment of Productivity Linked Reward from the year 2014-15 to 2015-16.
The payment of PLR would be made after adjusting the ad-hoc amount already paid for the year 2014-15.
The expenditure on account of PLR shall be met by the Major Port Trusts and Dock Labour Boards from their own resources without any Budgetary support from the Government.
This will benefit about 44,000 major Ports and Dock workers/employees/officer and will help ensure a better industrial relationship and congenial work atmosphere in the Port Sector apart from stimulating better productivity.
The Major Port Trusts/Dock Labour Boards will be immediately informed on due dates to make payment of the PLR, as per the existing scheme to all employees/ workers/officers for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16.
