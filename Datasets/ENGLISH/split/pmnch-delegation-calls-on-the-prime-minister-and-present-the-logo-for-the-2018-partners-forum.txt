Prime Minister shared his personal experiences on the initiatives taken in Gujarat for increasing institutional deliveries through partnership with the private sector and organising community feeding for the poor and pregnant women in villages so that their nutrition needs could be met.
He stressed on effective communication strategy.
He also emphasised that ‘participation is partnership’.
The Prime Minister also suggested that we should involve people across the globe, specially young people in important issues like nutrition, age of marriage, pre-natal and post-natal care and seek ideas for effective implementation and communication for programmes for women, children and adolescents.
He suggested that we could have an online quiz competition on these themes and provide awards to prize winners in the upcoming Partners’ Forum Meeting in December 2018.
