PM invites views and experiences on dealing with the menace of drugs
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has invited views and experiences on dealing with the menace of drugs.
“During ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, I talked about many friends writing to me on menace of drugs.
I said I will take it up in next programme.
I invite you to share your views on the issue of mitigating the menace of drugs.
If you worked in this area, please share your experiences.
I call upon NGOs that are working on this to share their experiences as well.
It will be wonderful to know about the work being done.
Here is the link of the MyGov Open Forum where you can share your comments, ideas, views & past work in the area. http://mygov.in/groupissue/tackling-the-drug-menace-in-india/show
