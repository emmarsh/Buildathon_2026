The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for transfer/exchange of 278 hectares of IAF land comprising of 288.74 acres of AAI land in possession of IAF in lieu of 400 hectares of land offered by the Government of Maharashtra for the development of the Nagpur airport project and simultaneous restoration of ownership of 288.74 acres of AAI land at present in possession IAF at Nagpur Civil Airport to AAI.
The State Government has offered 400 hectares of land in lieu of 278 hectares taking into account the cost of relocation of the existing assets of IAF.
This has also been found appropriate by IAF as additional land for extension of runway etc. is required for the GAJRAJ project of IAF.
The 278 hectares land in possession of IAF is located at 5 different pockets thereby restricting IAF to develop the GAJRAJ project in an integrated manner.
IAF needed a single plot of land for expansion of runway and development of GAJRAJ project.
At the same time, the IAF land falling in the MIHAN airport boundary is required for the development of MIHAN project.
The additional land of 122 hectares has been offered by the State Government to meet the cost of existing assets of IAF which cannot be relocated.
The proposed exchange of land is not only beneficial for the airport project of MIFIAN but also required for the integrated development of the GAJRAJ project of IAF and hence both the IAF and MIHAN are in a win-win situation.
