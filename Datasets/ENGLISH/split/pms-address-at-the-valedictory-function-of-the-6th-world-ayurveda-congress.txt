PM: Biggest challenge is with people dedicated to Ayurveda – they themselves do not trust it fully.
PM: Ayurveda can make a global impact, like Yoga.
PM: Ayurveda practitioners should be dedicated to Ayurveda for serving mankind, not just as a profession.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today said the biggest challenge to Ayurveda comes from people who have dedicated their life to it.
They too do not trust it fully, he said.
Seeking to dispel the notion of Ayurveda and Allopathy being competing streams of medical science, the Prime Minister described Ayurveda as a way of life.
He said a disease can be cured by Allopathy; and if a person adopts Ayurveda, he can ensure that he remains healthy and free of disease.
He called upon practitioners of Ayurveda to be dedicated to Ayurveda not just as a profession, but as a service to mankind.
He was speaking at the valedictory function of the 6th World Ayurveda Congress.
The Prime Minister said that Yoga had acquired global recognition for people who wanted a stress-free life and were moving towards holistic healthcare.
Similarly, if Ayurveda is presented in the right spirit as a way of life, it too can acquire acceptance.
The Prime Minister said it is essential for Ayurveda to reach people in a simple, effective way.
For this, the modes of treatment should also be better packaged.
Shri Narendra Modi said space has to be created in international medical and science publications, for articles on Ayurveda.
But the effort for this has to come from the practitioners and researchers of Ayurveda, he added.
