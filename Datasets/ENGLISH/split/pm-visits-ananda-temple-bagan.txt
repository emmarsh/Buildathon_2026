The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited the Ananda Temple, at Bagan in Myanmar.
This is a Buddhist temple built in the early 12th century.
It is the second largest temple in the entire Bagan region.
The Archaeological Survey of India has carried out structural conservation and chemical preservation work of this temple.
Restoration work is being carried out after damage during the earthquake last year.
The Prime Minister was shown a photo exhibit depicting the ongoing restoration work at the temple.
He offered prayers and made a Parikrama of the temple, during which ASI representatives explained the restoration process.
The Prime Minister signed the visitors’ book at the Temple, and unveiled a plaque signifying the contribution of India, in the restoration of the Ananda Temple.
The ASI has undertaken several major conservation works across various countries of Asia.
Besides the Ananda Temple, these include the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Ta Prohm Temple in Cambodia, the Vat Phou Temple in Laos, and the My Son Temple in Vietnam.
