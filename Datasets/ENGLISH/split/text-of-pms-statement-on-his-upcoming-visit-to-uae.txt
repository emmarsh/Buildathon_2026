On 16th August, I begin my visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
This will be the first Prime Ministerial visit in 34 years.
UAE is a valued partner and the extent of our ties indicate the vibrant relations India and UAE enjoy- India is UAE’s 2nd largest trading partner and UAE is India’s 3rd largest trade partner.
There are over 2.5 million Indians who have made UAE their home.
They have contributed immensely to the progress of UAE and also given back to India at every occasion.
India and UAE are fantastically connected be it via air or through the sea.
The economic strides taken by UAE are extremely admirable.
UAE is a global economic success story that has attracted people from all over the world.
UAE has also emerged as an important logistics hub.
UAE and India’s strong partnership goes back several years.
Both are multicultural societies that respect and celebrate plurality and diversity.
During my visit, I seek to enhance cooperation in energy, trade and will talk to investors on why India is an attractive destination to invest.
I am certain my visit will boost people-to-people ties between our Nations.
I specially look forward to meeting the large community of Indian workers based in UAE.
No words will be enough to appreciate their hardwork and sweat over the last many years.
I will hold extensive talks with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, whose enlightened vision and farsightedness has taken UAE to new heights of development.
I will meet His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE.
One of the places that I will visit in UAE is the Masdar City, a zero carbon city, which is an effort towards creating a cleaner and greener tomorrow.
