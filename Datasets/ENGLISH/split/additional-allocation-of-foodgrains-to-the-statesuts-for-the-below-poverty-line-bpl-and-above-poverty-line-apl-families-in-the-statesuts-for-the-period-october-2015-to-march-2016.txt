The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has come into force w.e.f.
5.7.2013 under which 2/3rd population of the country will be provided foodgrains at highly subsidized rates of Rs. 2/- per kg for wheat and Rs. 3/- per kg for rice.
The coverage under the Act is based on 2011 population estimates.
It was expected that the Act will be implemented in all the States/UTs latest by September, 2015 and beneficiaries will start receiving highly subsidized wheat and rice under the PDS System.
Accordingly, additional allocation for APL and BPL families during the current financial year was made to non NFSA States/UTs only upto September, 2015.
20 States/UTs have begun implementing the NFSA while the rest of the States/UTs are still under existing TPDS.
These States are, however, under active preparation to implement the NFSA within the next few months.
Hence the Government has decided to continue the monthly additional APL and BPL allocation to the non-NFSA States/UTs from October, 2015 to March, 2016 or till implementation of the Act in these States/UTs, whichever is earlier, at APL and BPL rates.
The expectation is that more and more States/UTs will shift as early as possible to NFSA implementation from the older TPDS pattern.
