“Jan Mann” (People’s attitude) has changed in India
Development is the solution to all problems India faces
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said a change has occurred in the “Jan Mann” (people’s attitude) in India.
Addressing a large gathering of the Indian community in Toronto, Canada, the Prime Minister illustrated how changing attitudes were bringing about positive developments in India.
He said bank officers had worked hard, and approached the underprivileged, unbanked sections of society, to ensure that 14 crore new bank accounts were opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
He also gave examples of two young women from Nagaland and Varanasi coming together to clean the Prabhughat in Varanasi; nearly four lakh people giving up LPG subsidy, and a newspaper writing to him, to inform him that it would only carry positive news one day of the week.
The Prime Minister said development is the cure to all problems faced by India.
He said India’s demographic dividend represented a huge asset, and 80 crore youth were the focus of all his policies.
He spoke of his Government’s vision and emphasis on skill development, and the importance of instilling a sense of “dignity of labour” in India.
He added that this would ensure that India can become a major global supplier of skilled manpower.
He said that just as “Jan-Mann” had changed, the attitudes of the youth had also changed, and youth were now willing to work hard – they just needed to be given the right opportunities.
He said India needed to produce job-creators, not job seekers.
The Prime Minister spoke of the MoU signed with France, that would allow components of nuclear power plants to be built in India.
He said those power plants could perhaps, one day, be energized using Uranium that would come from Canada.
He said this was a big step in enhancing clean energy production in India.
This would enable one-sixth of humanity to make a contribution to protect the environment, he added.
