The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for swapping of Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) land out of land demised to M/s.
Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd.
(MIAL) at CSIA measuring 2960.90 sqm. with equivalent land of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) for relocation of Cemetery.
Swapping of the land with MCGM will enable M/s MIAL to complete the development work of CSIA, Mumbai.
Further, shifting of the cemetery to new location will result in its operationalization.
Since both the AAI land and the private land proposed to be swapped are of the same size and are adjacent to each other, as also the circle rate of the land is same, there is no financial implication on the Government.
However, the cost on account of mutation of the alternate land after swapping shall be borne by M/s MIAL.
