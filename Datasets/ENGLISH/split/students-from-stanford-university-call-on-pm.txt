A group of 25 students of International Policy Studies from Stanford University, US, called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today.
The group included students from various countries, including India.
Welcoming the students to India, the Prime Minister said that they are all soon-to-be policy-makers, and therefore, what they assimilate at this point in time, will definitely shape their decisions and choices in the near future.
In the course of the interaction, the Prime Minister answered questions on diplomatic relations between countries, India’s relationship with neighbouring countries, the Act East Policy, his recent visit to Silicon Valley, his commitment to technology and e-governance, and competitive cooperative federalism.
