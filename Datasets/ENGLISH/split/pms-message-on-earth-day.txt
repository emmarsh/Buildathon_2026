Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has given his message on Earth Day.
“Earth Day is the perfect occasion to reaffirm our commitment to keep our Planet clean, green and focus on sustainable development.
We belong to a culture that believes in the Mantra- “माता भूमिः पुत्रोऽहं पृथिव्याः” (Earth is our Mother and we are her children).
Caring for the environment is an integral part of our ethos.
India can truly show the way to the world in mitigating climate change,” the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.
