The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has invited suggestions from the people on `International Day of Yoga` and services in Indian Embassies, on the MyGov platform.
“Share your ideas & inputs on marking the first ever `International Day of Yoga`, on this MyGov Open Forum. http://mygov.in/groupissue/celebration-of-international-day-of-yoga/show
Friends from the diaspora, share your inputs on certain aspects pertaining to our Embassies abroad. http://mygov.in/groupissue/your-experience-at-the-embassy/show
The inputs on the Embassies received through MyGov would be very valuable for the Conference of Heads of Mission, being held in February”, the Prime Minister said.
