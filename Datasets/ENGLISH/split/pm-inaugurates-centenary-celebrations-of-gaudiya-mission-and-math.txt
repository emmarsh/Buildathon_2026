The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Centenary Celebrations of the Gaudiya Mission and Math in Kolkata.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said India’s spiritual consciousness is the reason for its long-standing civilizational ethos.
He said this spiritual consciousness had remained intact through the ages.
The Prime Minister said this consciousness transcended even language.
The bhajan“Vaishnav Jan To Tene Re Kahiye Re” is a prime example of this, he said.
He added the words “Vaishnav Jan” could easily be replaced with “Jan Pratinidhi” (Public Representatives) in the modern context.
The Prime Minister said that reform in the Indian society always came from within, and Raja Rammohan Roy, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar were prime examples of this.
The Prime Minister later offered prayers at the Gaudiya Math.
