Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Nepal.
“I will be visiting Nepal on 11-12 May 2018 at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon’ble KP Sharma Oli.
This will be my third visit to Nepal as Prime Minister.
It reflects the high priority India, and personally I attach to our age-old, close and friendly ties with Nepal.
My visit closely follows the State Visit of Prime Minister Oli to India last month.
These high-level and regular interactions reflect my government’s commitment to the ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, in consonance with the motto of ‘SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas’.
Together, our two countries have completed several bilateral connectivity and development projects in the last few years, and have initiated transformational initiatives for the benefit of our two peoples.
Prime Minister Oli and I will have the opportunity to take forward our recent wide-ranging discussions in New Delhi on issues of mutual interest, and to advance our cooperative partnership across diverse sectors.
In addition to Kathmandu, I am also looking forward to visiting Janakpur and Muktinath.
Both these places attract a large number of pilgrims every year.
They are living testimony to the ancient and strong cultural and religious ties between the peoples of India and Nepal.
As Nepal enters a new era of consolidating gains of democracy and achieving rapid economic growth and development, India will continue to remain a steadfast partner of Government of Nepal to implement its vision of ‘Samriddha Nepal, Sukhi Nepali’.
I am looking forward to meeting the political leaders and friends in Nepal.
I am confident that my visit will further cement our people-centric partnership with Nepal on the basis of mutual benefit, goodwill and understanding.’’
