The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Rail Vikas Shivir at Surajkund through video conferencing.
He said that this is a technology driven century, innovation is essential, and so the Railways has to be about both ‘Gati’ (speed) and ‘Pragati’ (progress).
He said that each official doing his own work is good but we also have to work together and think about how we want the Railways to be.
The Prime Minister emphasized that Indian Railways has to develop and be financially strong.
He said this will benefit India and particularly those working for the Railways.
The Prime Minister said that the focus of his Government’s Rail Budgets has never been politics, and the Government has worked towards a paradigm shift in the Railways.
The century has changed and so must the systems in our Railways, the Prime Minister asserted, adding that he is confident that the team that we have can achieve this.
Recalling that his childhood was spent on rail platforms, the Prime Minister said that his link with the Railways is strong, and that is all the more reason why he wants to transform the Railways.
