“Three things are important for the shram-yogi: self reliance (swavalamban), self independence (swashray) and self-dignity (swabhimaan).”
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today launched “Swavalamban Abhiyan” – a set of 11 new pro-poor initiatives of the Gujarat Government, at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar.
Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that 17th September is observed as Vishwakarma Day across the country, and Vishwakarma is revered by all shram-yogis (people who live through hard work).
Congratulating the state government, he said it is significant that the state government has chosen this day to launch “Swavalamban” initiatives.
The Prime Minister said three things are important for the shram-yogi: self reliance (swavalamban), self independence (swashray) and self-dignity (swabhimaan).
He said no “shram yogi” likes to be dependent.
Gujarat Government has launched these pro-poor initiatives for the benefit of shram yogis, especially women and youth, so that they are empowered to fight poverty, he added.
This is in keeping with the spirit of “Shrameva Jayate,” he said.
The Prime Minister said that women in Gujarat are at the forefront of animal husbandry and milk production, and they will be benefited and empowered through this scheme.
He also said ITIs in the state are focusing on soft skill development, so that the students can communicate their skills and abilities.
The Prime Minister said the neo-middle class will also receive protection through the Swavalamban initiative of Ma-Vatsalya Yojana.
