PM inaugurates Badarpur-Faridabad Metro Line
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today declared that the respect for armed forces veterans and those who laid down their lives for the nation is paramount for the country.
Recalling his promise of delivering One-Rank, One-Pension for the armed forces personnel, the Prime Minister said the Union Government had fulfilled this promise, with the announcement made yesterday.
He said that the cost of implementing this promise would be around Rs. 8000 crore to Rs. 10,000 crore, which was significantly higher than some estimates that had been made earlier.
The Prime Minister was speaking after inaugurating the Badarpur-Faridabad Metro Line at Faridabad.
The Prime Minister regretted that it had become a fashion to politicize every decision taken by the Union Government for the progress of the country.
Asserting that no one should mislead the jawans and the people of the nation, the Prime Minister said that the country would progress not through Raj-neeti (politics), but through Rashtra-neeti (nationalist policies).
The Prime Minister said that a significant proportion of army jawans were from Haryana, and therefore, the announcement of OROP would contribute significantly to Haryana’s economy.
Reiterating that development is the solution to all problems, the Prime Minister said the Union Government is taking all steps for India’s development.
He said the whole world had recently faced economic difficulties, but India’s economy had stood firm.
He added that all State Governments and the Union Government had to move forward shoulder to shoulder.
He reiterated his Government’s resolve for Housing for All by 2022.
The Prime Minister travelled from Central Delhi to Faridabad, and back, by metro.
In the course of the journey, he interacted with several people, especially youth, who were also travelling on board the metro train.
