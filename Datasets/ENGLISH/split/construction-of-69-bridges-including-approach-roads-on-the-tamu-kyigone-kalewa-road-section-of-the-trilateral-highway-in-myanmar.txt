The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the construction of 69 Bridges including Approach Roads on the Tamu-Kyigone-Kalewa (TKK) road section of the Trilateral Highway in Myanmar at a cost of Rs.371.58 crore.
This will impart all weather usability to the TKK road section, which is also part of the route for the proposed Imphal-Mandalay bus service.
It will improve connectivity between India and Myanmar and facilitate movement of goods and traffic.
Background:-
During the visit of Prime Minister to Myanmar in May 2012, it was agreed, at the request of Government of Myanmar, to undertake construction of 71 bridges in the Tamu – Kyigone – Kalewa (TKK) road section of the Trilateral Highway.
The Government of Myanmar has started work on constructing two bridges, on its own, as these bridges needed urgent attention.
As a result, construction of the balance 69 bridges will be undertaken under Government of India’s assistance.
The project will be implemented in Engineering Procuring and Construction (EPC) mode through Project Management Consultant (PMC).
It will be closely monitored by the Indian Embassy in Yangon, PMC and the Ministry of External Affairs.
The project is envisaged to be completed by mid-2019.
