The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today joined the members of the Rajya Sabha, in bidding farewell to the retiring members of the House.
Speaking on the occasion, he said the country has benefited from the knowledge and experience shared by the members who are retiring today.
He said that the Rajya Sabha helps broaden the outlook and horizons of the members.
The experience enriches them, and this wealth is for the nation and the society, he added.
He expressed the hope that the experience and knowledge of the retiring members would continue to be beneficial for the nation.
He said that the members who are retiring today, have been a part of many important decisions.
He added that it would have been even better if two more decisions, which could have benefited the States immensely, had been taken in the presence of these members.
One of these, he said, is the GST Bill, and the other is the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, which would have enabled a large amount of funds to be disbursed to States for afforestation.
The Prime Minister wished the retiring members well, and on behalf of the Government, thanked them for their cooperation.
