The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of Election Commission for purchase of 4,10,000 Ballot Units (BUs) and 3,14,000 Control Units (CUs) during 2017-18 and 4,35,306 Ballot Units and 71,716 control units during 2018-19 at a tentative unit cost of Rs.7,700/- and Rs.9,300 respectively.
The total estimated cost will be Rs.1,009.6 crore.
The purchases will be made through Bharat Electronic Ltd.(BEL), Bangalore and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd.
(ECIL), Hyderabad.
The Cabinet has also authorised the Election Commission to vary the quantity to be ordered on M/s.
BEL and M/s.
ECIL based on their production capacity and past performance in supply of machines.
This would facilitate phasing out of obsolete electronic voting machines procured during 2000-2005.
It will enable the Election Commission to replenish the stock with a view to meeting the requirement of conducting General Elections to Lok Sabha and some of the State Assemblies due in 2019.
Authorising the Election Commission to vary to the quantity would ensure better management of the procurement process and timely delivery of the units.
