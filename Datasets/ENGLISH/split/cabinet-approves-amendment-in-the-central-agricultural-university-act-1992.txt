The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the amendment in relevant clauses of the Central Agricultural University Act (CAU), 1992 to include State of Nagaland under the jurisdiction of CAU, Imphal.
After inclusion of State of Nagaland under jurisdiction of the Central Agricultural University, Imphal, the College of Veterinary Sciences in Nagaland will produce the much-needed professional manpower in the fields of animal husbandry, which will facilitate socio-economic growth in the region.
The new college will help familiarize the farmers with new techniques, thereby contributing to the production and productivity of domestic animals in the State of Nagaland.
The amendment will help the State of Nagaland reap the benefit of the CAU, Manipur, which is established for the entire North Eastern Region.
