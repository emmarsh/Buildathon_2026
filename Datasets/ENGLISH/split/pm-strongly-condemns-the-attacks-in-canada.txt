Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has strongly condemned the attacks in Canada.
“I strongly condemn the attacks on the Canadian military personnel in Quebec and Ottawa and the shooting in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa.
A Parliament is a temple of democracy and holds a special place in the hearts of those who believe in democratic ideals.
As a nation that has experienced a horrific terrorist attack on its Parliament, we share the sense of outrage and trauma of the people of Canada over the attack on the highest institution of democracy.
I express, on behalf of the people of India, our condolences to the people of Canada for the loss of their soldiers and our solidarity with them at this difficult moment.
Canada is one of India’s strongest partners and we will continue to strengthen our cooperation in combating terrorism and other crimes for a safer future for our people”, the Prime Minister said.
