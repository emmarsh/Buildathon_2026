PM attends function for distribution of e-rickshaws in Lucknow, interacts with rickshaw pullers and their families
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended a function organised by Bharatiya Micro Credit for distribution of e-rickshaws in Lucknow.
The Prime Minister interacted with rickshaw-puller families in a chaupal setting.
During the interaction, subjects such as saving of a portion of the additional income, and education of children, came up for discussion.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said the whole world has recognised that India is the fastest growing major economy in the world today.
He added that this is happening despite the global recession.
He said that the primary objectives of his Government are the welfare of the poor, and employment for the youth.
The Prime Minister said youth should become job creators instead of job seekers.
He added that his Government has taken a series of steps to fulfil these objectives.
In this context, he mentioned that 2 crore people had benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, in less than a year of the scheme’s launch.
The Prime Minister said that for the people who are getting e-rickshaws today, it is not just a simple change from pedal rickshaw to e-rickshaw, but an entire transformative process.
The Prime Minister symbolically handed over RuPay cards, and social security schemes to select beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister flagged off the rally of 2100 e-rickshaws.
