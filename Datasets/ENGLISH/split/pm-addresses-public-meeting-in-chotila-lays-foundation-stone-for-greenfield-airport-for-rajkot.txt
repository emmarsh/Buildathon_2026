He said such development works empower citizens.
He said aviation cannot be about rich people.
We have made aviation affordable and within reach of the lesser privileged, he added.

From the days when handpumps were seen to be a sign of development, today the waters of the Narmada River have been brought for the benefit of citizens.
He said Surendranagar district tends to benefit a lot from the waters of the Narmada.
He urged people to use water responsibly, and conserve every drop.
The Prime Minister said that the Sursagar Dairy would bring enormous benefit to the people.
