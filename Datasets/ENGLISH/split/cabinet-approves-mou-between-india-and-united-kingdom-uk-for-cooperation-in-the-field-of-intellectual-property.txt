The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the MoU between India and United Kingdom (UK) for Cooperation in the Field of Intellectual Property (IP).
The MoU was signed on 7.11.2016.
The MoU seeks to establish a wide-ranging and flexible mechanism for developing and furthering the cooperation in the development of automation, new documentation and information systems in IP.
It provides an opportunity for collaboration in training programmes, exchange of experts and technical exchanges and outreach activities.
Implementation of the MoU will result in enhancement of the capacity of the Office of Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks to examine patent applications, which in turn will impact innovation positively.
