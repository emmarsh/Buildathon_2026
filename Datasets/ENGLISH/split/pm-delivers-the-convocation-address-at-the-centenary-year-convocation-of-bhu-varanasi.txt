The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the Convocation Address at the Centenary Year Convocation of the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
Paying homage to Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya, the founder of the University, Shri Narendra Modi described him as a visionary, who sought to prepare a dedicated, capable set of people with knowledge or values for nation building.
The Prime Minister said that a Convocation should not be treated as the end of education.
He added that the student within a person should always be kept alive.
The Prime Minister urged students to face even adversity with equanimity.
He said the youth must seek to innovate to solve challenges facing the country and the world.
In this context, he gave examples of sickle cell anaemia, global warming, and solar energy.
The Prime Minister referred to school-children from nearby Government run schools, who were present at the function, as his special guests.
He urged the medal winners to interact with them, so that they too feel inspired to achieve.
