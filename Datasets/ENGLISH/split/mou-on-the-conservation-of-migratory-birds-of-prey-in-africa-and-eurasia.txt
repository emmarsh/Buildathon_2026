The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to sign Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia, also called the ‘Raptor MoU’ with the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS).
With the signing of this MoU, India will become the 54th signatory to the MoU.
Background:-
Raptor MOU was concluded on 22nd October 2008 and came into effect on 1st November 2008.
The Raptor MoU is an agreement under Article IV paragraph 4 of the CMS and is not legally binding.
The MoU seeks willingness of the signatory Range States for working for conservation of the raptor species and their habitats.
An action plan has been formulated which primarily envisages the conservation action for Raptor species.
The Raptors MoU extends its coverage to 76 species of birds of prey out of which 46 species including vultures, falcons, eagles, owls, hawks, kites, harriers, etc. also occur in India.
Considering that the Raptor MOU is also in conformity with the provisions of the existing Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, wherein the birds have been accorded protection, India would gain domain knowledge which would be helpful in effectively managing the habitats of these Raptors, including concerted trans-boundary efforts for conservation through interaction with other range countries by signing of the MoU with the CMS.
Pakistan and Nepal are the other neighbours who are signatories to this MoU.
The CMS or Bonn Convention, under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range.
India had become a party to the CMS since 1st November 1983.
