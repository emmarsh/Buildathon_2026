Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of Kalaignar Karunanidhi.
“Deeply saddened by the passing away of Kalaignar Karunanidhi.
He was one of the senior most leaders of India.
We have lost a deep-rooted mass leader, prolific thinker, accomplished writer and a stalwart whose life was devoted to the welfare of the poor and the marginalised.
Kalaignar Karunanidhi stood for regional aspirations as well as national progress.
He was steadfastly committed to the welfare of Tamils and ensured that Tamil Nadu’s voice was effectively heard.
I have had the opportunity of interacting with Karunanidhi Ji on several occasions.
His understanding of policy and emphasis on social welfare stood out.
Firmly committed to democratic ideals, his strong opposition to the Emergency will always be remembered.
My thoughts are with the family and the countless supporters of Karunanidhi Ji in this hour of grief.
India and particularly Tamil Nadu will miss him immensely.
May his soul rest in peace”, the Prime Minister said.
