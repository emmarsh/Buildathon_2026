The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, paid tribute to the founder of the Tata Group, Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, saying that those who create history, without seeking or holding power, are truly great.
The Prime Minister was speaking after the release of a commemorative coin to mark the 175th Birth Anniversary of Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata.
He praised Jamsetji Tata for his vision of environment friendly energy, and for his initiatives for welfare of the people associated with the Tata Group.
The Prime Minister said that the culture of businessmen donating massive amounts in charity was new to the western world, but Jamsetji Tata had done the same long ago.
Shri Narendra Modi also referred to the meeting between Swami Vivekananda and Jamsetji Tata, on board a ship from Japan to Canada in 1893.
He said the two great men – one an ascetic and the other an industrialist – shared the same wavelength, and had a common vision for a self-reliant India.
The Prime Minister said it was a privilege for him to be releasing a commemorative coin in honour of Jamsetji Tata.
The MoS (Finance) Shri Jayant Sinha, and the Chairman, Tata Sons, Shri Cyrus Mistry were present on the occasion.
