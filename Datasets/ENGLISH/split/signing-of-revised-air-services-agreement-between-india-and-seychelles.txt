The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for the signing of the revised Air Services Agreement (ASA) between India and Seychelles to modernize and update the existing ASA signed on 30.10.1978.
The ASA signifies an important landmark in the civil aviation relations between India and Seychelles and has the potential to spur greater trade, investment, tourism and cultural exchanges between the two countries.
As a result of this agreement, the number of flights between India and Seychelles has been increased from three per week to seven per week.
