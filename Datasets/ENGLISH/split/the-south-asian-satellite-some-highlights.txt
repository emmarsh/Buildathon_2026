• Space diplomacy has touched new heights with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unique gift in the sky to South Asian neighbours.
• The gift of a communications satellite for use by neighbours at no cost has perhaps no precedent worldwide.
• The satellite, which weighs over 2 tonnes, has been fabricated in three years at a cost of over Rs. 230 crore.
• Its footprint that extends all over South Asia.
• The South Asia Satellite has 12 Ku band transponders which India’s neighbours can utilise to increase communications.
• Each country will get access to at least one transponder through which they could beam their own programming.
The satellite will facilitate DTH television, VSAT links, tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support.
It will provide critical communication links in times of disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and tsunamis.
• Heads of Government from all the seven South Asian nations who are benefiting from the satellite, connected via video conference, in a unique celebration of the successful launch.
