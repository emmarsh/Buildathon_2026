Background
The Government of India has since 2006-07 been subsidizing short-term crop loans to farmers in order to ensure the availability of crop loans to farmers for loans upto Rs.three lakh at seven percent per annum.
This interest subvention scheme has been further continued for 2014-15 for PSBs, Private Sector Banks, RRBs and Cooperative Banks.
In the year 2009-10, an additional subvention of 1 percent was provided to farmers who repay their loans on time.
This has been increased from 2 percent in 2010-11 to 3 percent in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14.
Thus, the effective rate of interest for such prompt-payee farmers is four percent.
Banks have been consistently meeting the target set for agriculture credit flow in the past years.
For the year 2014-15, the target for agricultural credit flow has been raised to Rs.8,00,000 crore from Rs. 7,00,000 crore in the year 2013-14.
