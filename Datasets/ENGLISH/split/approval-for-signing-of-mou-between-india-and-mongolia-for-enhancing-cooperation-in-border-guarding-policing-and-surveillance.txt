The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Mongolia for cooperation in Border Guarding, Policing and Surveillance.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will strengthen bilateral cooperation in the field of Border Management as both the countries’ borders are porous and have difficult terrain.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will also increase effectiveness in border security co-operation and best practices sharing.
This would help in providing necessary peaceful ambience which is a prerequisite for the development of society as a whole.
