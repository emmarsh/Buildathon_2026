Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met India’s Blind World Cup winning team.
The team had won the 4th ODI World Cup, 2014 for the Blind, hosted by South Africa earlier this month.
The Prime Minister was presented a special cricket ball which is used for blind cricket.
He later asked the players to sign on the ball, adding that he would present this ball to a museum in a cricket club.
The Prime Minister told the players that they had not only brought laurels to the India, but had also inspired many physically challenged people through their feats.
The Prime Minister met each of the cricketers individually, and posed for photographs with them.
