The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the promulgation of the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Value Added Tax (Amendment) Regulation, 2005 by the President under article 240 of the Constitution.
This will substitute the clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 4 of the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Value Added Tax Regulation, 2005 with the amendment, namely “(b) in respect of goods specified in the Third Schedule, at the rate of five percent.”
This will help the Union territory to generate additional gross revenue and net tax generation that is estimated to be Rs.120 crore and Rs. seven crore per annum respectively.
