The Prime Minister will join thousands of volunteers, performing Yoga asanas in the lawns of Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, located in the lap of the Himalayas.

Nor is Yoga only what you practice in the morning.
Doing your day-to-day activities with diligence and complete awareness is a form of Yoga as well,” the Prime Minister said.

In a world suffering from mental stress, Yoga promises calm.
In a distracted world, Yoga helps focus.
