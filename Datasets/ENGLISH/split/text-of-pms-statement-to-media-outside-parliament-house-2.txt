The second half of the budget session of the parliament gets underway today.
The discussions are likely to be focused mainly on the financial matter.
The first half of session of this session was very productive.
The political parties tried together to ensure smooth conduct of the parliament and many important decisions were taken.
The bliss of this was visible on the faces of the MPs.
I believe, this time also, the members will engage themselves in discussing issues in a democratic spirit with the same zeal and enthusiasm.
The healthy practices of democracy will be carried forward with free discussions in this session and important decisions will be taken.
Thanks
