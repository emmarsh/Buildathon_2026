The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Jagran Forum, organized in New Delhi by Jagran Prakashan Limited.
The Prime Minister used the quote “Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty,” to emphasize the importance of awareness in democracy.
He said a vibrant democracy requires Jan Bhaagidaari – the participation of the people.
The Prime Minister recalled how Mahatma Gandhi had turned the freedom struggle into a people’s movement.
He said this model of “Jan-Andolan” should be applied to the country’s development process as well.
The Prime Minister said laws made before independence were based on the premise that people should not be trusted.
However, this approach should now change.
In this context, the Prime Minister gave examples of self-certification of documents, the people’s participation in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and the Give-it-up campaign for LPG subsidy.
The Prime Minister explained how the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, and the “Start Up India – Stand Up India” initiatives were creating a positive impact.
The Prime Minister also explained the approach of “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” and said archaic laws were being weeded out.
