29 Officer Trainees of the 2012 batch of Indian Foreign Service, called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, at 7, Race Course Road today.
This is the largest batch of the IFS, and also has the largest number of lady probationers.
Shri Modi congratulated the IFS probationers on their selection as representatives of India to the world.
Interacting with the probationers, the Prime Minister exhorted them to be well-acquainted with India`s history, and its historical links with various countries of the world.
Shri Modi said the probationers should reflect the essence of India`s image and self-esteem, as they take up their assignments across the world.
He added that as members of the Foreign Service, they should also motivate the Indian diaspora to take pride in India.
The Prime Minister said that the focus should be on expansion of trade and commerce, and technology transfer.
He said India needs to concentrate on `zero-defect manufacturing` and `packaging and presentation`, to boost its exports.
Giving an illustration, he said Indian herbal medicines were among the best in the world, but are lagging behind Chinese products due to poor packaging.
Similarly, the huge diversity and range of Indian handicrafts has not been presented properly to the world.
The Prime Minister exhorted the Officer-Trainees to become catalytic agents to convey the strengths of India to the world, so that mutually beneficial exchanges can take place.
Shri Ajit Doval, NSA, Shri Nripendra Misra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, and Smt.
