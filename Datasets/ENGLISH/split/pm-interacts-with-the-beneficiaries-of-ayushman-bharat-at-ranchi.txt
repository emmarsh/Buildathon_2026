Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PM-JAY) aims to reduce the financial burden on poor and vulnerable groups arising out of catastrophic hospital episodes and ensure their access to quality health services.
The scheme envisions health assurance of 5 lakh rupees per family per year, to benefit over 50 crore people, and is the world’s biggest health assurance scheme.
The number of beneficiaries of this scheme is roughly equal to the population of the European Union, or the population of America, Canada and Mexico, taken together.
