Today, the people of Nepal have shown how much love they have for me and the people of India.
At many places in Kathmandu, people received me with such warmth, it shows the affection they have for the people of India.
I also felt that Nepal is moving ahead on the path of development with new hope and energy.
The process of Constitution-making is also moving forward.
Mr. Sushil Koirala’s struggle for democracy is an inspiration for all.
My doors are open, I invite you to bring any suggestions to review the 1950 Treaty, if you so want.
