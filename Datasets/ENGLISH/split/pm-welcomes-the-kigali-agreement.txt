The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has welcomed the Kigali Agreement, which has been signed by 197 nations – including India – in Kigali, Rwanda, with the goal of curbing the use of climate-altering hydroflourocarbons (HFCs).
“The Kigali Agreement to the Montreal Protocol reached this morning is a historic occasion, which will have a lasting impact on our planet.
Agreement will lead to a reduction of 0.5 degree in global temp by the end of the century and enable us to achieve the goals set in Paris.
The flexibility and cooperation shown by India as well as other countries has created this fair, equitable and ambitious HFC agreement.
This will also provide a mechanism for countries like India to access and develop technologies that leave a low carbon footprint.
I congratulate all countries for having come together on this critical issue, which will contribute to a greener Earth”, the Prime Minister said.
