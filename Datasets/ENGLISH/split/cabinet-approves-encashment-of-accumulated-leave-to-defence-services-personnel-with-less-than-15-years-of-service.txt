The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved leave encashment up to 180 days in respect of those Defence personnel who died or were invalidated out of service between 30.12.1991 to 29.11.1999 with less than 15 years of service.
The decision will benefit the families of 9777 Officers and other personnel of Defence Services who died or were invalidated out of service during this period.
This period is very significant as a large number of casualities took place during the Kargil conflict (“Operation Vijay”) and in counter insurgency operation in J&K and North East during the period.
