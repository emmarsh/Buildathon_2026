The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved Amendment to the Trade Unions Act, 1926 to make provisions regarding Recognition of Trade Unions.
Benefits:
The approval will facilitate:
Recognition of Trade Unions at Central and State level; Ensure true representation of workers in the tripartite bodies; Check on the arbitrary nomination of workers’ representatives by the Government; and Reduce litigations and industrial unrest.
The proposed Bill will ensure that the nomination of workers’ representatives in tripartite bodies by the government will become more transparent.
Trade Unions so recognized would be accountable in maintaining industrial harmony.
Recognition of Trade Unions at Central/State level would reduce duplicacy of such exercise by different departments.
Recognized Trade Unions may be assigned specific roles at Central or State level.
