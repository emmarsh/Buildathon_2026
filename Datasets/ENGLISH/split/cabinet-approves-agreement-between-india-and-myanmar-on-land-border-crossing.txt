The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Agreement between India and Myanmar on Land Border Crossing.
The Agreement will facilitate regulation and harmonization of already existing free movement rights for people ordinarily residing in the border areas of both countries.
It will also facilitate movement of people on the basis of valid passports and visas which will enhance economic and social interaction between the two countries.
The Agreement is an enabling arrangement for movement of people across India-Myanmar border.
It is expected to provide connectivity and enhance interaction of the people of North Eastern States of India with the people of Myanmar.
The Agreement would give a boost to the economy of the North East and allow us to leverage our geographical connections with Myanmar to boost trade and people to people ties.
The Agreement will safeguard the traditional rights of the largely tribal communities residing along the border which are accustomed to free movement across the land border.
