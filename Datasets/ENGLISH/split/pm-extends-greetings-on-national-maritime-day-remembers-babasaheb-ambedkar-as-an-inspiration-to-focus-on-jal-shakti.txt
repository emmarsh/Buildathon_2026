Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has extended his wishes on National maritime Day.
PM said, “The maritime sector in India, with its rich history, has the potential to power our nation’s transformation.
On National Maritime Day, we affirm our commitment to harness our maritime strengths for the nation’s prosperity.
Our efforts for a vibrant maritime sector are inspired by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
It was Babasaheb who gave topmost importance to Jal Shakti, waterways, irrigation, canal networks and ports.
His work in this sector augured extremely well for the people of India.”
