The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for proposal to remove difficulties in granting license to the drivers of the e-rickshaws and e-carts by amending the Section 7 (1) of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, and adding the definition of e-rickshaw and e-cart under the Act.
E-Rickshaws and e-Carts provide affordable and clean last mile connectivity in the transport system.
The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has notified rules under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, to bring the e-Rickshaws and e-Carts within the legal framework ensuring tests for approval of prototype for safety standards before registration of the vehicles.
Such vehicles have been allowed limited power and speed.
Under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, no person can be granted a Learner’s License to drive a transport vehicle, unless he has held the Driving License for a period of at least one year.
As most of the e-rickshaws and e-carts drivers do not have any license, the existing provision will debar them from operating e-Rickshaw / e-Cart for the next one year.
In order to remove this difficulty, and facilitate plying of e-rickshaw and e-carts, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has proposed to amend Section 7(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which will give relaxation to e-rickshaw and e-cart drivers only.
In addition, the definition of e-rickshaw and e-cart has been included under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
