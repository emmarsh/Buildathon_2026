The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Official amendment to the Rajendra Central Agricultural University Bill, 2015 for change of name from “Rajendra Central Agricultural University” to “Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University”.
Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa is to fulfill the desired goal and achieve excellence in teaching and produce the much-needed manpower educated in agriculture and allied sciences.
This would help in getting over the shortage of technical manpower and infrastructural facilities and would contribute to the development of agriculture, including animal husbandry, horticulture and fisheries in the region.
The existing colleges will help familiarise the farmers with new techniques, thereby contributing to the production and productivity of agriculture in the region.
