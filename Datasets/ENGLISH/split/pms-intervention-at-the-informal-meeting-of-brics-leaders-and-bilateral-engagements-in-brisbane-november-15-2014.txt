Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said repatriation of unaccounted money from abroad was a key priority for his Government.
He was making an intervention at the meeting of BRICS leaders ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane.
He said unaccounted money abroad posed both economic and security challenges.
The Prime Minister said this G20 meeting was happening in the shadow of continued weak global economic growth.
He said political turbulence in many parts of the world, and the Ebola pandemic were also factors of concern.
Therefore, he said, there is need for a positive environment to achieve economic goals, and G20 can support this effort.
He said there is a strong need to give a message to revive economic confidence and boost growth and job creation.
The Prime Minister also stressed on the need for better international policy coordination, and the need to reform global economic institutions.
He suggested the creation of a digital hub for sharing of information and best practices for infrastructure.
The Prime Minister also held bilateral meetings with the President of France, Mr. Francois Hollande, and the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper.
This was the first time he met both leaders, and both of them invited him to visit their countries.
The Prime Minister has accepted both invitations.
In his meeting with Mr. Harper, he condemned the recent attack on the Canadian Parliament.
In both meetings, the Prime Minister reiterated his stand that religion should be delinked from terrorism.
