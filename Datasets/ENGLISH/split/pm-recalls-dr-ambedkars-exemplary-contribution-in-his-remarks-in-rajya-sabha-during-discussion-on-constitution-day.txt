The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said that the Constitution of India is not about laws alone, but is a social document, that we can turn to, whenever we need guidance and inspiration.
He was speaking during a discussion to commemorate Constitution Day, and the 125th birth anniversary of the architect of the Constitution, Dr B. R. Ambedkar.
The Prime Minister said the Constitution gives us the strength to go forward together, and said that this was an occasion to pay homage to all members of the Constituent Assembly.
He said the nation cannot ignore or forget the exemplary contribution of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The Prime Minister outlined his vision of Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat, which he had first referred to, at the “Run For Unity,” on Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary.
In the course of his remarks, the Prime Minister quoted Dr. Ambedkar, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and Max Mueller, and highlighted various aspects of their vision.
