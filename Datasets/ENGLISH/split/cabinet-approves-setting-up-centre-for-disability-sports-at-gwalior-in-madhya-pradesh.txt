The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for setting up of a Centre for Disability Sports at Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, to be registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.
It will function under the name of Centre for Disability Sports, Gwalior.
Setting up of the Centre shall entail an estimated cost of Rs 170.99 crore, spread over a period of 5 years.
Impact:
Improved sports infrastructure created by this Centre will ensure effective participation of persons with disabilities in sports activities and also enable them to compete at national and international levels.
Setting up of the Centre will develop a sense of belonging in Divyangjan to facilitate their integration in society.
Details:
For overall superintendence and supervision of the Centre, there will be a Governing Body consisting of members, not exceeding 12, with some serving in ex-offidocapacity and others coming in as experts from National Level Sports Federations apart from experts in para games.
Background:
Section 30 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, enjoins on the Government to take measures to ensure effective participation of Persons with Disabilities in sports activities which, inter-alia, includes provision of infrastructural facilities for sports activities for them.
The Finance Minister in his Budget Speech of 2014-15 announced the setting up of a Centre for disability sports.
At present no specialized sports training facilities for Divyangjan are available in the Country.
This void is proposed to be filled up by setting up sports infrastructure so that persons with disabilities (Divyangjan) can undergo rigorous and specialized training in this Centre.
