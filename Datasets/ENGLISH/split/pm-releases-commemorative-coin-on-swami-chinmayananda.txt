Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released a commemorative coin to mark the birth centenary of Swami Chinmayananda.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled the pioneering work of Swami Chinmayananda in the field of education and social reform.
He described Swami Chinmayananda as a visionary, who saw the need to inculcate India’s great culture and spiritual traditions, through the English medium, among an “elite” class of people, who had moved away from this heritage.
Speaking about Swami Chinmayananda, the Prime Minister said that when Swami ji talked about the Geeta, he was a Gyan-Margi (one who follows the path of knowledge), and when he worked in his schools and hospitals, he was a Karm-Margi (one who follows the path of work).
He said, that in this sense, Swami Chinmayananda’s life is an inspiration for others.
The Prime Minister recalled his meetings with Swami Chinmayananda, and said it was a matter of great pride that a commemorative coin was being issued to mark his centenary.
Union Minister for Finance Shri Arun Jaitley, Union MoS for Finance Shri Jayant Sinha, Global Head of Chinmaya Mission Swami Tejomayananda, and National Director of Chinmaya Yuva Kendra Swami Mitrananda, were present on the occasion.
