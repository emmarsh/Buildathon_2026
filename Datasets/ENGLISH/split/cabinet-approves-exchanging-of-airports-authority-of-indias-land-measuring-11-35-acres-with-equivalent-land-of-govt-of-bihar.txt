The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to transfer 11.35 acres of land to Airports Authority of India (AAI) by way of exchanging equivalent land of AAI at Anisabad.
The proposed land at Patna Airport will be used for expansion of the airport and construction of new terminal building along-with other associated infrastructures.
The State Government has also agreed in principle for transfer of the land.
The new terminal building will be having a capacity of 3 million passengers per annum which will not only enhance the airport capacity but also provide convenience to general public.
Background:-
The existing terminal building at Patna Airport was built for a capacity of 0.5 million passengers per annum, against which 1.5 million passengers per annum are already using the airport.
This has led to extreme crowding in the terminal building.
