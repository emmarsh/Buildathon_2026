The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for signing of Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between India and Germany for minor amendments in the earlier MoU for facilitating implementation of the programme “Indo-German Partnerships in Higher Education”.
By signing the JDI, the term “Strategic” will be deleted from the title of the programme to make it “Indo-German Partnership in Higher Education” and the funding period for the programme will be changed from 2015-19 to 2016-20 (from 1st July 2016 to 30th June, 2020).
The strengthened education relationship through this Joint Declaration of Intent will enable the higher education institutions in both the countries to benefit mutually to enhance innovative partnerships in the field of education, research and skill development.
It will be beneficial for faculty development and to foster advanced research in the identified priority areas of challenges for India.
