The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today described the “Right To Information” Act as a tool through which the common man has got not just the right to know, but also the right to question those in power.
In his remarks at the 10th Annual Convention of the Central Information Commission (CIC), the Prime Minister said that the Union Government’s “Digital India” initiative is complimentary to RTI, because putting information online brings transparency, which in turn, builds trust.
The Prime Minister mentioned the auctions of coal blocks, spectrum and FM radio licenses, and said that information should be given out proactively to people.
The Prime Minister called for an end to the silo-approach in Government.
He said administrative processes should be run based on trusting the people, rather than doubting the people.
The Prime Minister said RTI has become a tool for good governance.
He also described how the PRAGATI platform developed in the PMO has become a vibrant platform for monitoring progress of projects.
