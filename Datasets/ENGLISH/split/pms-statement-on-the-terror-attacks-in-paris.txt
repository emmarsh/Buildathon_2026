I condemn the barbaric terrorist attacks in Paris in the strongest terms.
More than hundred people lost their lives while they were doing what they loved, or spending time with their loved ones.
We feel the shock, pain and outrage of the people of France.
India stands firmly with the great people of France in dealing with this tragedy.
And we must stand together as humanity in combating the major global threat of our times and to uphold our values and our way of life.
