Mr. Han Zheng, Party Secretary of Shanghai and Member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
The Prime Minister fondly recalled his meeting with Mr. Han Zheng in Shanghai, during his visit to China last year.
Mr. Han Zheng said that Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Shanghai last year, and the resultant increased awareness about India, has led to an increase in the number of people from Shanghai visiting India.
The Prime Minister said that the Mumbai-Shanghai Sister City Agreement has laid the foundation for strong relations between the financial capitals of India and China.
The Prime Minister added that the establishment of the India-China Provincial Leaders’ Forum was also a welcome step towards broadening and strengthening the bilateral relations between India and China.
Prime Minister Modi and Mr. Han Zheng discussed the current global economic scenario and noted that strong economic growth in India and China can act as an engine of growth for the global economy.
