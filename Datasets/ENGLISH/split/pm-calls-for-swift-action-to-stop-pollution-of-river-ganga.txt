Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has called for time-bound, swift action and single-minded focus to stop pollution of the River Ganga.
He was chairing a high-level meeting on the ‘Namaami Gange’ project today.
The Prime Minister reiterated that the ‘Namaami Gange’ vision should focus primarily on two main areas to check pollution at the source.
These include: urban sewage and industrial effluents.
“Ganga ko ganda na karen,” the PM emphasized.
The Prime Minister was briefed extensively on critical hotspots along the stretch of the river, which generate the most pollution.
The existing gaps in sewage treatment capacity were highlighted.
A total of 764 grossly polluting industrial units have been identified along the stretch of the Ganga.
Tanneries, pulp and paper and sugar industries account for over three-fourth of this number.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the need to promote recycling of industrial waste water.
He said industrial units should be motivated suitably to stop pollution, failing which action should be initiated within the framework of existing laws.
The Prime Minister also called for exploring the possibility of setting up modern, environment-friendly crematoria along the River Ganga, through private initiative and enterprise.
The concept of a network of volunteers to help end pollution of the river – ‘Ganga Vahini’ – has been approved.
Steps are being taken to operationalize this network.
118 Urban Local Bodies have been identified to be covered within five years, in a targeted attempt to control pollution.
The Prime Minister was also briefed on ongoing sewerage and river front development projects.
The meeting was attended by Union Ministers Shri Venkaiah Naidu, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Ms. Uma Bharati, Shri Prakash Javdekar and top Government officials.
