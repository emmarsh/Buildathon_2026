The Union Cabinet Chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the exchange of scattered plots of land of Directorate General of Lighthouses & Lightships (DGLL) with land of M/s JSW Jaigarh Port Limited at Jaigarh Lighthouse, Ratnagiri, Maharashtra.
The swapping of land will ensure separate and independent access to the facilities of DGLL and JSW-JPL besides allowing land consolidation to both of them for their unhindered development and better security management of their respective premises.
The DGLL will hand over 12 pieces of land measuring 0.7630 Hectare and will receive three pieces of land measuring one hectare.
Background:
The JSW-JPL is facing hindrances in their operations as the scattered plots of land of DGLL are located in the midst of the storage area of the port, which in turn has been affecting the customs and The International Ship and Port facility Security (ISPS) compliance by the port.
DGLL has also been facing hindrances in the future expansion activities of their Lighthouse as its land parcels are scattered, isolated and not contiguous from lighthouse operational point of view.
The proposed land swapping would be mutually benefitting both DGLL and JSW-JPL besides enabling efficiency of their respective operations as also ensure better and more secure management of their respective lands.
