This has reference to reports appearing in a section of the media over the past several weeks, mentioning the Prime Minister, and referring to the conduct of some Union Ministers, and alleged misconduct of the Home Minister’s son.
The reports are plain lies, motivated and constitute a malicious attempt at character assassination and tarnishing the image of the Government.
Those indulging in such rumour-mongering are damaging the interest of the nation.
These reports are strongly denied.
