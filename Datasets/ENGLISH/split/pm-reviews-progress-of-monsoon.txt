The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired a high-level meeting to review the progress of the monsoon so far.
The meeting was attended by the Ministers for Home, Finance, Agriculture, Food and Consumer Affairs and Water Resources; Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister and Additional Principal Secretary to Prime Minister.
Officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) apprised the Prime Minister of the monsoon situation.
They said that though the monsoon has been delayed, rainfall is likely to improve substantially in the months of July and August.
The Prime Minister also reviewed the position of water reservoirs and fodder stock.
He directed that maximum possible use be made of the existing water resources, and best practices in rainwater harvesting.
The Ministry of Agriculture has prepared a contingency plan for more than 500 districts.
Shri Narendra Modi stressed on the need for both Centre and States to proactively mount a coordinated effort in implementing the advance action plan for the monsoon, with districts, rather than states, being the unit of planning.
The Prime Minister emphasized on ensuring adequate power and seed availability for the agricultural sector, and directed that NREGA be used to generate rural employment, if necessary.
Shri Modi also reviewed the steps being taken to contain inflation.
It was observed that the measures are having a positive effect, with adequate rice stocks reaching markets.
There is now no shortage of onion stocks in Delhi.
The Prime Minister said states should set up special courts for speedy trial of hoarders and black-marketeers.
