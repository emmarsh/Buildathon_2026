My dear fellow Indians and citizens of the world,
Namaste!
A very warm welcome to the official website of the Prime Minister of India.
On 16th May 2014 the people of India gave their verdict.
They delivered a mandate for development, good governance and stability.
As we devote ourselves to take India’s development journey to newer heights, we seek your support, blessings and active participation.
Together we will script a glorious future for India.
Let us together dream of a strong, developed and inclusive India that actively engages with the global community to strengthen the cause of world peace and development.
I envision this website as a very important medium of direct communication between us.
I am a firm believer in the power of technology and social media to communicate with people across the world.
I hope this platform creates opportunities to listen, learn and share one’s views.
Through this website you will also get all the latest information about my speeches, schedules, foreign visits and lot more.
I will also keep informing you about innovative initiatives undertaken by the Government of India.
Yours, Narendra Modi
