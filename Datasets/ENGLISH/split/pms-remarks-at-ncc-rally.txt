The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today called upon the NCC cadets to dedicate their lives to the nation and the welfare of its people.
Addressing cadets from across the country on the occasion of the NCC Rally, the Prime Minister urged NCC cadets to imbibe the good things that they would have observed over the last one month, during their stay in Delhi for the Republic Day celebrations, and also to spread these values, such as cleanliness and patriotism, when they go back to their towns and villages.
He said the NCC is an institution which connects youth from across the country, and hence contributes towards a sense of unity in the nation.
The Prime Minister mentioned that this Republic Day marks the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Babasaheb Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution of India.
He said that despite facing adversity throughout his life, Babasaheb Ambedkar was able to use the churning that this hardship would have caused within him, to produce the nectar of the Constitution, which helps us walk shoulder to shoulder, even after so many decades.
