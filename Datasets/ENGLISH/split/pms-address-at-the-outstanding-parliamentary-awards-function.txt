Prime Minister Narendra Modi has highlighted the importance of the combination of three qualities “Netritva, Kartutva, Vaktutva” – Leadership, Action and Speech – as essential in the making of an Outstanding Parliamentarian.
Addressing the Outstanding Parliamentarian Awards function at the Balyogi Auditorium in Parliament Library today, the Prime Minister urged the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to convene a meeting of Speakers of all Vidhan Sabhas, so that the practice of awarding outstanding legislators could be extended to the states as well.
Complimenting the three award winners – Shri Arun Jaitley, Shri Karan Singh and Shri Sharad Yadav – for their contribution to Parliament, the Prime Minister hoped that younger MPs would learn from the examples set by them.
The Prime Minister said the country is looking at Parliament with a lot of hope, adding that it may also be worthwhile to conduct a survey among the people as to how they judged a particular session of Parliament.
This may be an eye-opener, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister regretted the decline of the use of wit and humour in the proceedings of Parliament in recent years.
The Prime Minister said sharp comments can give us space for a short time – but cannot impact or inspire.
He said the time had come when every sentence said in Parliament should be an inspiration for the country.
