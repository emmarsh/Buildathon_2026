The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, to reimburse Rs. 113.40 crore of losses on pulses imported between 2006-2011 by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Project and Equipment Corporation (PEC), State Trading Corporation (STC) and Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC), apart from losses incurred in the sale of pulses upto six months after closure of the scheme.
This will enable the Central PSUs to intensify trading activities to cool down prices.
In order to ensure retail distribution to the consumers, it was decided to import 5000 tonnes of Tur Dal and 5000 tonnes of Urad Dal by MMTC, a Central PSU.
The first consignment of imported Dal would be reaching Mumbai by 5.9.2015.
The Union Government has taken several measures to increase availability and control the price of essential commodities, especially pulses and onions.
States have been empowered to impose stock limits on pulses, export of all pulses is banned except Kabuli Chana, organic pulses and Lintels to the tune of 10,000 MTs.
Besides there is zero duty on import of pulses.
