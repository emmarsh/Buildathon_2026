Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has commended bank officers and staff, on the excellent work put in by them in rolling out the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana successfully.
In an email, the Prime Minister said he is delighted by the unprecedented response it has received so far.
Over 5 crore bank accounts have been opened within 5 weeks of launch against a target of 7.5 crore accounts in the first year.
“This is primarily due to your diligence and commitment.
I had urged you to ensure that no one is left behind without a bank account.
I always had faith in the ability of our system to rise to any challenge and with your unflinching dedication, sense of purpose and hard work, your results have far exceeded expectations,” the Prime Minister said.
“However, as we move ahead from here, the journey is bound to become more difficult and achievements harder to come by.
Reaching the last few who do not have bank accounts is going to be progressively more difficult.
We must not slacken our efforts in ensuring full coverage,” the Prime Minister added.
“This is also the time to reflect and make mid-course corrections as required.
A lot of effort will be required in promoting financial literacy amongst the new account holders.
New accounts also need to be kept alive and properly utilized.
Aadhaar numbers will need to be seeded in bank accounts.
Facilities like e-KYC must be gainfully utilized.
Bank branches and Bank Mitras will have to play a more proactive role so that every account holder is reached by a banking agent regularly,” the Prime Minister said.
“I am confident that with the kind of enthusiasm and commitment that you have demonstrated, we will succeed in achieving Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana’s objectives as planned,” the Prime Minister said.
