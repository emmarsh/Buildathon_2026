Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today, presented President Emomali Rahmon a specially commissioned miniature painting of the tomb of the 17th century Indian poet Abdul Qadir Bedil who is regarded, especially in Tajikistan, as one the greatest masters of Persian poetry.
Born in 1644 in Patna, Bedil was influenced by Sufism and wrote 16 books of poetry.
Bedil died in Delhi where his tomb, Bagh-e-Bedil is located.
The miniature painting has been done by national award-winning Delhi-based artist Jai Prakash.
