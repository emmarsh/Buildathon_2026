On manufacturing, the Prime Minister said that the ecosystem for electronics manufacturing in India should now be focused on manufacture of medical equipment devices.
The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of maintaining a positive working environment in Government, in order to make it an “organic entity.”
He said that as new laws are made, old ones should be reviewed and weeded out if found unnecessary.
Highlighting the current positive global environment in favour of India, the Prime Minister asked officers to work with clear objectives towards creating a New India by 2022.
He asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.
