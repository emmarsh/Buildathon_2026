The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said the following, on his upcoming visit to Japan:-
“On 30th August I will begin my visit to Japan.
I am keenly looking forward to the visit, which will boost relations between our 2 Nations.
Japan visit will be my first bilateral visit outside the subcontinent.
I was to visit in early July but could not due to Parliament session.
I see the Japan visit as an opportunity to take our ties with Japan to a new level and increase cooperation in various fields.
I will visit Tokyo and Kyoto, and will interact with all sections of Japanese society from students, political leaders to captains of industry.
Have very warm memories of visiting Japan as a Chief Minister.
The hospitality and the immense scope for cooperation left a deep impression on my mind.
The scale of innovation and level of precision among the people of Japan is admirable.
Both our Nations can learn a lot from each other.
Am particularly excited to meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
I deeply respect his leadership and enjoy a warm relationship with him from previous meetings.
Japan’s friendship with India is time tested.
We are 2 vibrant democracies committed to advancing peace and prosperity in the world.”
