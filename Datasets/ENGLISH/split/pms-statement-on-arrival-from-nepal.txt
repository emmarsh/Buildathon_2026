I have just returned to Delhi after two memorable days in Kathmandu.
I want to thank President Ram Baran Yadavji, Prime Minister Sushil Koiralaji, the Government of Nepal, all the political parties, officials, security personnel and, above all, the people of Nepal for the extraordinary warmth and affection with which I was welcomed in Nepal.
It made feel as though I had come home.
This experience has moved me and added another dimension to my personal relationship with Nepal.
I felt deeply honoured with the privilege to speak to the Members of the Constituent Assembly of Nepal.
During my two-day visit, I felt the strong urge for political stability and economic prosperity in everyone I met in Nepal.
I am confident that Nepal, rich in resources, talent and diversity, will quickly carve out its destiny as a stable, inclusive and prosperous nation that will be a source of pride for South Asia and an inspiration for others around the world.
I also believe that together we have laid the foundation for a new relationship between our two countries, which will draw strength from our deep ancient links and prepare us to together address the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.
I will leave no stone unturned to translate our vision into reality, and our commitments into action.
I not only look forward to returning to Nepal in November and to the opportunity to visit other places, but to a more sustained process of political engagement between India and Nepal.
