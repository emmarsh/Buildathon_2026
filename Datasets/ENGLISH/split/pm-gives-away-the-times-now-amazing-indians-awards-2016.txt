PM gives away the “Times Now” Amazing Indians Awards 2016
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave away the “Times Now” Amazing Indians Awards 2016.
The awards were given in recognition of great achievements in the face of adversity.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said the awardees were people whose life journey had been like a diamond, that passes through great travails before being recognized and acknowledged by the world at large.
The Prime Minister regretted that in India, most of the narrative has been built around the lives of those in power, or the ruling class.
Those who have struggled and achieved noble objectives, or served society, despite severe obstacles and adversity, are rarely recognized and celebrated, he added.
The Prime Minister said that today in India, a teacher who might have inspired hundreds of young children to become responsible members of society, often remains unnoticed and unheard, while even a relatively junior political functionary is feted.
The Prime Minister said that the world over, most of the great achievers have been those, who overcame personal hardships, or difficult circumstances, and yet contributed to society.
Reflecting on Indian history and mythology, the Prime Minister gave several illustrations from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and recalled the Panj Pyaaras, and the brave Maratha warriors who were part of Chhatrapati Shivaji’s army.
The Prime Minister complimented Times Now for discovering and presenting to the world at large, the awardees for the day, and said their work would inspire many others.
He complimented the awardees for their achievements.
