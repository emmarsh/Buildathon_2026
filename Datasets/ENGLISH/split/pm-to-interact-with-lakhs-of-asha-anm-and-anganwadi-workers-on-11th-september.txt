The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will interact with lakhs of ASHA, ANM, Anganwadi workers, and health beneficiaries, via video conference, as part of “Poshan-Maah”, at 1030 hrs on 11th September, 2018.
“Poshan Maah” (the month devoted to nutrition), is being celebrated in September 2018, across the country.
It aims to reach every household in the country with the message of the importance of optimum nutrition.
This effort will further the objectives of Poshan Abhiyaan (the National Nutrition Mission), which was set up by the Union Government in November, 2017.
The mission aims to reduce the level of stunting, under-nutrition, anemia and low birth weight babies.

Towards this end, the Prime Minister’s interaction will bring together various stakeholders involved in the mission.
It will also become a platform for sharing and dissemination of success stories in the area of nutrition.
