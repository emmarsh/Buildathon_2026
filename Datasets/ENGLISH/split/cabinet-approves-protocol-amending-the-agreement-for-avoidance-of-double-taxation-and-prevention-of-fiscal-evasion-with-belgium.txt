The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved today the signing of a Protocol amending the Agreement between India and Belgium for avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.
The amendment in the Protocol will broaden the scope of the existing framework of exchange of tax related information between the two countries, which will help curb tax evasion and tax avoidance.
The Protocol will also revise the existing treaty provisions on mutual assistance in collection of taxes.
