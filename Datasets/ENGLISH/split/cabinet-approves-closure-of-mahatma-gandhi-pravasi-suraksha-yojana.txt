The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved closure of the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Suraksha Yojana (MGPSY) which was set up in 2012 to address the social security-related issues of the Emigration Check Required (ECR)-category workers going abroad for employment to ECR countries.
The subscription under the MGPSY was very low and no new subscription was received for more than a year.
Closure of the scheme will, therefore, obviate the avoidable recurring administrative and record-keeping expenditure.
