The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the creation of two posts equivalent to Joint Secretary level in the Interpreters’ cadre of the Ministry of External Affairs.
The decision will help in augmenting expertise of the Interpreters’ cadre and help meet the specialized requirements for training of the Interpreters.
This measure would be important in addressing the increasing requirements for interpretation in the backdrop of significantly enhanced high-level bilateral and multilateral engagements of the Government of India globally.
