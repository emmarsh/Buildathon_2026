The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the function for the release of the book “Citizen and Society,” written by the Vice-President Shri Hamid Ansari.
The book was released by the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, at Rashtrapati Bhawan.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the Vice President for presenting his thoughts to the future generations through the book.
He said today technology has converted citizens to netizens, and traditional boundaries are being obliterated.
However, in India, he said, there is a unit called “Family” between Citizen and Society, which has been our biggest strength.
He said India should be proud to be a country of so many dialects and languages, and so many different faiths, living in harmony.
He said all citizens have made a contribution to make this happen.
