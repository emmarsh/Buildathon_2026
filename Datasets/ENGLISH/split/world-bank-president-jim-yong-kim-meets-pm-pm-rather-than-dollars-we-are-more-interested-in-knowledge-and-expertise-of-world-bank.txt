The President of the World Bank, Dr. Jim Yong Kim called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today.
Later, the Prime Minister described the meeting as “very fruitful.”
“We discussed several ways of working together in the times to come,” he said.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister also said:
“We talked about the importance of scale and the need to work on a scale that inspires people and positively transforms their lives.
We live in a world where speed matters.
Quick execution is essential.
Speeding up World Bank projects will surely increase the impact.
Rather than dollars, we are more interested in knowledge and expertise of World Bank.
Dr. Kim agreed and said World Bank can be our information bank.
We want ideas from the World Bank not only on mass production but also on production by masses, which will benefit our workforce.
Today the world focuses on trade in goods but in future the core issue will be how to get skilled people.
We need to work in this direction.
I also suggested to Dr. Jim Yong Kim that the cleaning of the Ganga would be a very inspiring project for the World Bank.”
