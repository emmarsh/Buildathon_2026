The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, today approved the introduction of the Indian Trusts (Amendment) Bill, 2014 in the current session of Parliament to amend section 20 and 20A of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882.
The amendments are intended to provide the trustees greater autonomy and flexibility to take decisions on investment of trust money.
This would enable the Central Government to notify securities or class of securities, for investment by trusts and to remove the outdated provisions occurring in section 20 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882.
