Background:
At present there is shortage of Government accommodation in National Capital Region.
This leads to Government officials waiting for eligible housing.
Thus, Ministry of Urban Development has moved a proposal for redevelopment of existing old dilapidated housing colonies to augment the housing stock by making optimum utilization of land resources as per Master Plan Delhi (MPD) – 2021 and using modern construction technology with green building norms and in-house solid / liquid waste management facilities.
