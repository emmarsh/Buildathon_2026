Salient features:
PISA is a competency-based assessment which unlike content-based assessment, measures the extent to which students have acquired key competencies that are essential for full participation in modern societies.
It would lead to recognition and acceptability of Indian students and prepare them for the global economy in the 21st century.
The CBSE and the NCERT will be part of the process and activities leading to the actual test.
Schools run by the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and schools in the Union Territory of Chandigarh will participate.
