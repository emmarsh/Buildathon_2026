Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today called for a holistic approach towards meeting the target of “Housing for All.”
Chairing a high-level meeting to assess the work done so far, both in the rural and the urban areas, the Prime Minister stressed on the need for all concerned official agencies to adopt a flexible approach, which takes into account local conditions such as building material, habits and lifestyles.
“A tribal may prefer a house made from traditional local materials rather than bricks and mortar; and therefore, should be facilitated accordingly,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that in rural areas, the goal should be achieved “village-by-village,” so that the progress is tangible, and can be monitored effectively.
He said all common facilities, and required connectivity should also be conceived and delivered, along with housing – so that we move towards the concept of “samasya-mukt gram,” (problem-free village).
For urban areas, Shri Narendra Modi suggested that urban solid waste can be used to make bricks, which would be useful as building material.
He said all newly-constructed houses should take into account the required norms in disaster-prone areas.
Minister for Urban Development Shri Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Rural Development Shri Chaudhary Birender Singh, and senior officers from the Ministries of HUPA, Rural Development, NITI Aayog and PMO were present.
