The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone for various development projects in Mumbai.
These include two metro lines, the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project Phase-III, and two elevated roads.
Earlier, the Prime Minister performed Jal Puja for the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj memorial, in the Arabian Sea, just off the Mumbai coastline.
Addressing a large gathering on the occasion at Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai, the Prime Minister said that even in the midst of struggle, Shivaji Maharaj remained a torchbearer of good governance.
Shivaji Maharaj was a multifaceted personality, and so many aspects of his personality inspire us, the Prime Minister said.
His courage was known, but there are so many more aspects of Shivaji Maharaj we must know about, such as his policies on water and finance, Shri Narendra Modi said.
The Prime Minister said that performing the Jal Pujan of the Shivaji Memorial was very special, and he is glad to have got the opportunity to do so.
Development is the solution to all problems, it is the way ahead, the Prime Minister asserted.
The strength of 125 crore Indians will bring about change in this nation, he added.
Our battle to fight corruption has been going on since the day we assumed office, and a historic decision was taken on 8th November, the Prime Minister said.
There were efforts to mislead and even intimidate people but they supported the battle against corruption and black money, the Prime Minister asserted.
The people of India will not accept corruption and black money, he added.
