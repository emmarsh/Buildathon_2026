The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said the Constitution of India had ensured “dignity of Indians, and unity of India.”
He was speaking in the Lok Sabha, on the occasion of the special sitting to commemorate Constitution Day, and the 125th birth anniversary of the architect of constitution, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.
The Prime Minister said that in a diverse country such as India, we need to actively take the provisions of the Constitution to the people.
The observance of 26th November as Constitution Day reflects the Union Government’s thinking in that light, he said, adding that the concept will evolve over time.
The Prime Minister said that no praise is enough for the people who created our Constitution, and added that Dr. Ambedkar’s contributions can never be denied.
Dr. B. R. Ambedkar’s thoughts and teachings have been valid, true, and applicable to all generations, the Prime Minister said.
He said that democracy becomes stronger through consensus and agreement; while the concept of majority and minority is always the last resort.
The Prime Minister said that citizens should pay equal attention to their rights and duties.
The Prime Minister described his “Idea of India” as “Satyameva Jayate” and “Sarva Panth Sambhav.”
