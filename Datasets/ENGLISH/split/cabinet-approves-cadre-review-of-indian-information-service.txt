The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the cadre restructuring of the Indian Information Service (IIS) Group ‘A’.
The restructuring will involve addition of two posts at apex level, five at Higher Administrative Grade and 19 posts at Senior Administrative Grade level with matching reduction at other levels.
The restructuring will address the problem of existing stagnation in the IIS Cadre and will improve the career prospects of IIS officers.
The Cadre review exercise will result in better functioning of media and communication arms of the government.
The Cadre review comes in the backdrop of ongoing efforts to expand the outreach of pro-people policies of the government and the need to disseminate the information of such measures which have grown manifold in the recent years.
