The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has saluted the services of civilian and defence officials and organisations in helping evacuate Indian citizens from Yemen.
“I salute the services of our civilian and defence officials and organisations in helping evacuate our citizens from Yemen.
Continue your efforts!
Seamless co-operation between organisations – Ministry of External Affairs, Navy, Air Force, Air India, Shipping, Railways and State Govts greatly helped in rescue work.
Colleagues Smt Sushma Swaraj and General VK Singh (who has been on the ground for days), have co-ordinated evacuation efforts in an exemplary manner.
I am also glad that India has rescued several non-Indian citizens from Yemen.
Our evacuation efforts in Yemen reflect willingness to serve our people and readiness to help others in distress, which is India’s ethos,” the Prime Minister said.
