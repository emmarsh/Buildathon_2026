The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today released a commemorative postage stamp on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.
Speaking on the occasion, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi, the Prime Minister appreciated Swami Paramahansa Yogananda, and said that the path shown by him is not about Mukti, but about ‘Antaryatra.’
He said that though Swami Paramahansa Yogananda left the shores of India to spread his message, he always remained connected with India.
The Prime Minister said India’s spirituality is its strength, and it is unfortunate that some people link even spirituality with religion, whereas the two are very different.
