Following is the text of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi`s tweets today, on school curriculum: “Am reading in the news that some states want to include Narendra Modi`s life struggles as a part of school curriculum.
I firmly believe that the life story of living individuals should not be included as a part of the school curriculum.
India has a rich history of several stalwarts who made India what it is today.
Young minds should read about these greats & emulate them.”
