The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme.
The Scheme has an outlay of Rs. 10,000 crore with a target of 50 lakh apprentices to be trained by 2019-20.
The Scheme would be implemented by Director General of Training (DGT) under Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).
It provides for incentivizing employers to engage apprentices.
25% of the total stipend payable to an apprentice would be shared with employers directly by Government of India.
It is for the first time a scheme has been designed to offer financial incentives to employers to engage apprentices.
In addition, it also supports basic training, which is an essential component of apprenticeship training.
50% of the total expenditure incurred on providing basic training would be supported by Government of India.
The Scheme will catalyze the entire apprenticeship ecosystem in the country and it will offer a win-win situation for all stakeholders.
It is expected to become one of the most powerful skill-delivery vehicle in the country.
Background:
