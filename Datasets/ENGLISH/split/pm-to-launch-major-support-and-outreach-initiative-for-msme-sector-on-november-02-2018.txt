The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will launch the Union Government’s Support and Outreach Initiative for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi on November 02, 2018.
Besides Delhi, similar launch programmes will be held at 100 locations across the country, where Union Ministers, and Ministers from State Governments will be present.
All these locations will also connect with Delhi, for the main event, which will include a special address by the Prime Minister.
He is expected to touch upon several matters of vital interest to the MSME sector.
The Union Government has accorded high priority to the MSME sector in recent years.
This outreach and support programme, which will run for the next 100 days, covering the entire country, is expected to provide even greater synergy to the efforts being made for this sector.
The progress of this programme, to be implemented in mission mode, will be monitored on a continuous basis by senior officials of Union and State Governments.
Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley and the Union Minister of State (I/C) for MSME, Shri Giriraj Singh, are among those who will be present on the occasion.
