The Cabinet today at the meeting chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi gave its approval for signing a treaty on transfer of sentenced persons between India and Nigeria.
Signing of the treaty shall facilitate Indian prisoners imprisoned in Nigeria or vice-versa to be near their families, for serving the remaining part of their sentence and shall facilitate their social rehabilitation.
The Government of India has so far signed Agreements with the Governments of the United Kingdom, Mauritius, Bulgaria, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, France, Bangladesh, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, the UAE, Maldives, Thailand, Turkey, Italy, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Israel, Russia and Vietnam.
Negotiations have also been concluded with the Governments of Canada, Hong Kong, Australia and Spain.
Background:
Prior to 2004, there was no domestic legislation under which foreign prisoners could be transferred to the country of their origin, to serve the remaining part of their sentence, nor was there a provision for the transfer of prisoners of Indian origin convicted by a foreign court to serve their sentence in India.
Hence the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred as Act) was enacted for serving this purpose.
For achieving the objectives of the Act, a treaty/agreement is required to be signed with countries having mutual interest with India and later to be notified in the Official Gazette.
