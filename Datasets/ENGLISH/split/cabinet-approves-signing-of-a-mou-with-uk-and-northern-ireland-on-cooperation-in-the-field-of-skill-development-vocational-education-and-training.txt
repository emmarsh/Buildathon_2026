The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Cooperation in the Field of Skill Development, Vocational Education and Training.
The MoU would pave the way for closer bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the field of vocational education and training and skill development.
The collaboration with foreign countries would help to strengthen the India skill eco-system thereby skilling youth for better employment prospects.
The MoU will create the framework for innovative partnership between India and the United Kingdom Industry and training institutes, and will help to scale up skill training efforts in India and enhance their quality.
Funding of projects related to the execution of this MoU will be structured in separate individual arrangements, mutually agreed by both parties.
Background:
Skill Development is a national priority for India and the United Kingdom and a key part of the bilateral partnership.
In November, 2016, the two Prime Ministers endorsed Skill Development and Entrepreneurship as one of the priority area for collaboration.
