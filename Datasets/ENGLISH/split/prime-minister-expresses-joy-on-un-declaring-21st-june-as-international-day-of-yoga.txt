“Elated!
Have no words to describe my joy on the UN declaring 21st June as ‘International Day of Yoga.’
I fully welcome the decision.
I profusely thank all 177 Nations across the world who co-sponsored the resolution to declare 21st June as ‘International Day of Yoga.’
Countless people across the world made Yoga an integral part of their lives.
Congrats to them!
This will inspire many more people towards Yoga.
Yoga has the power to bring the entire humankind together!
It beautifully combines Gyan (knowledge), Karm (work) and Bhakti (devotion),” said the Prime Minister.
