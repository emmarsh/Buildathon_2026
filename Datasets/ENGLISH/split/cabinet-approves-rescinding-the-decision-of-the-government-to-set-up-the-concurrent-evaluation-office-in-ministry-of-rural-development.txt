The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has decided to rescind the earlier decision of the Government to set up the Concurrent Evaluation Office (CEO) for managing Concurrent Evaluation Network (CENET) in Ministry of Rural Development.
The CEO was envisaged to undertake concurrent evaluation of Rural Development programmes in conjunction with Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of the erstwhile Planning Commission.
The decision will pave the way for a need based strengthening of the Economic and Monitoring Wing of the Ministry of Rural Development for managing and carrying out evaluation studies of Rural Development programmes.
