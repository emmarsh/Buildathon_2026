Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, after the formal Consultation Meeting with Chief Ministers on the new institution to replace the Planning Commission, held a Retreat with the Chief Ministers.
The Retreat is a first of its kind where the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers met without the support of any officials in a relaxed, private setting and discussed developmental issues and specific success stories in their states.
The purpose is to learn from each others’ successes so that they could be replicated in other states.
Chief Ministers highlighted one area each where they had done something innovative and which had a visible impact, either in improving governance or in improving service delivery to citizens.
All the participants felt that this was an extremely useful exercise which could be repeated in future.
