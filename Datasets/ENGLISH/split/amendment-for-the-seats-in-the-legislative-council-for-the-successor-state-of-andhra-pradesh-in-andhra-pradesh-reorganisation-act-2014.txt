The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for amending section 23(1) and section 23(2)(i)(a) of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 to rectify the anomaly in allocating the number of seats in Andhra Pradesh State Legislative Council and to enhance the total number of seats to 58 as per the provisions of the Constitution.
Since the existing strength of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly is 175 and 1/3rd of its strength is constitutionally permissible, it is hence proposed to increase the strength to 58 MLCs from current strength of 50 MLCs.
