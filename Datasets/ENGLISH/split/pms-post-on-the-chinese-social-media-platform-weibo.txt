PM’s post on the Chinese social media platform, Weibo
My greetings to the people of China on the occasion of your National Day.
Our relations date back to centuries, encompassing spiritualism, learning, art, trade and respect for each other’s civilisation and shared prosperity.
As I have said earlier, both our countries reflect, in many ways, similar aspirations, challenges and opportunities, and can be inspired by each other’s successes.
At a time when the world looks towards Asia, the progress and prosperity of China and India, and our close cooperation, have the potential to shape a peaceful and stable future for Asia.
This is a vision I share with President Xi and Premier Li.
In recent times, we have deepened our engagement across the full spectrum of our ties, and laid emphasis on deepening mutual trust and confidence, and expansion of people-to-people ties.
And we will continue our endeavours in this direction.
