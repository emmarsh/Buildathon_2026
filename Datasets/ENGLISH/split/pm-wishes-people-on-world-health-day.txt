Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has wished people on World Health Day.
PM said, “Good health is the foundation of human progress.
This World Health Day, I wish all of you remain in the best health and continue to scale new heights of growth.
I welcome the theme ‘Universal health coverage: everyone, everywhere’ that has been chosen by WHO and others.
It is the quest for Health For All that inspired us to create Ayushman Bharat, the largest healthcare programme in the world.”
