The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has appealed to friends and well-wishers not to celebrate his birthday; and to instead, dedicate themselves towards relief work in Jammu and Kashmir.
“I am hearing from different places that friends & well-wishers are planning various programmes and events for my birthday.
My humble request – do not celebrate my birthday.
Instead, dedicate yourselves towards relief work in Jammu and Kashmir through your time and resources.
The need of the hour is to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters and brothers of Jammu and Kashmir.
On 17th, President Xi Jinping will be in Gujarat.
We look forward to extending a warm welcome to him but there will be no birthday celebrations,” the Prime Minister said.
