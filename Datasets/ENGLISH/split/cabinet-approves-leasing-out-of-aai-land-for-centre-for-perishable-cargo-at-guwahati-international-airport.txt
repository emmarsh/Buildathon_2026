The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for leasing out of AAI land measuring 4050 sq.
Mtrs. to Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC), a Government of Assam Undertaking.
This will be utilised for setting up of Centre for Perishable Cargo (CPC) and its future expansion at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport (LGBI Airport), Guwahati.
The land is to be leased by AAI on a token licence fee of Rs.1/- per annum for a period of seven years subject to signing of Lease Agreement.
After expiry of initial period of seven years, the future lease period will be made afresh as per AAI policy in-vogue.
Background:
North Eastern Region (NER) in India is rich in flora and fauna.
Revenue from export of agriculture and horticulture items will improve economic conditions of NER.
There is a need for promotions of perishable cargo export from this region, which will generate employment opportunities directly or indirectly.
Facilities for air upliftment of perishable cargo from Guwahati are required to be more effective.
Therefore, it has been decided to lease land measuring 4050 sq.
Mtrs. to AIDC, by AAI for setting up of CPC and its future expansion at LGBI Airport, Guwahati.
