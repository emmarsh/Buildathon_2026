The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today gave its approval to move official Amendments in the Appropriation (Acts) Repeal Bill, 2015 and the Repealing and Amending (Third) Bill, 2015 respectively and to pursue for consideration of the said Bills pending in Rajya Sabha.
The enactments repealed in reality have lost their meaning and are still on the Statute-Books.
The repealing of Acts whose terms have ended, will in no way cause any negative impact on actions that were validly taken under these laws and have become irrelevant or dysfunctional and their repeal will serve the purpose of cleaning the Statute-Book and reduce the burden on the Statute-Book.
