Background:
Indus Waters Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 for sharing of Indus waters.
According to the Treaty, India got the full rights for utilization of waters of the three Eastern Rivers namely Ravi, Beas and Satluj.
Some of the water of the River Ravi at present is going waste through the MadhopurHeadworks downstream to Pakistan.
Implementation of the project would minimise such wastage of water.
A Bilateral agreement was signed between Punjab and J&K in Jan, 1979.
As per the agreement, construction of RanjitSagar Dam (Thein Dam) and Shahpurkandi Dam was to be taken up by Punjab Govt.
RanjitSagar Dam was commissioned in Aug, 2000.
The ShahpurKandi Dam project is proposed on River Ravi, 11 d/s of RanjitSagarDam and 8 km u/s of Madhopur Head Works.
The Project was initially approved by the Planning Commission during November, 2001 and was included under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Scheme (AIBP) of this Ministry for funding its irrigation component.
Revised cost of the ShahpurKandi Dam National project was approved by the Advisory Committee of MoWR, RD & GR on 24th August, 2009 for Rs. 2285.81 crore Central Assistance of Rs. 26.04 crore was released during period 2009-10 to 2010-11.
However, the works could not progress much due to non-availability of funds on the part of Govt. of Punjab for power component and later interstate issues with J&K.
Series of meetings were held bilaterally as well as at Govt. of India level.
Finally, an agreement was reached between Punjab and J&K states under the aegis of MoWR, RD&GR at New Delhi on 8th September, 2018.
