On behalf of the Government and people of India, I warmly congratulate you on your re-election to the high office of Prime Minister of the State of Israel.
This is testament to the trust and confidence reposed by the people of Israel in your leadership.
As I had conveyed to you in my telephonic conversations on 29th March and 30th April, 2015, we attach high importance to our relations with Israel and seek a broad-based and mutually beneficial engagement.
We appreciate the personal commitment you have made to furthering our ties.
I am confident that our two governments will continue to work closely to strengthen our multifaceted relations and expand our cooperation to new areas, particularly in the hi-tech sector.
I take this opportunity to convey to you my best wishes for your good health and well-being and for the continued progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the State of Israel.
