The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today urged the Gems and Jewellery sector in India to look beyond the domestic market and establish a global presence.
Speaking at a felicitation function organized for the Prime Minister, by the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, Shri Narendra Modi called for innovation and skill development to achieve this objective.
He noted that there is an increasing global demand for handmade jewellery.
Recalling recent issues related to excise duty, the Prime Minister said these issues gave an opportunity for the Gems and Jewellery industry to better understand the working of the Government, and it also gave the Government an opportunity to better understand the intricacies of the sector.
He said both have won over each other.
The Prime Minister called upon all those with undisclosed income, to declare it before the September 30th deadline.
