The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle, at an event in Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi.
Speaking on the occasion, he said this five-volume dictionary contains an account of the martyrs from India’s First War of Independence in 1857, to India’s Independence in 1947.
He said that this includes the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the non-cooperation movement, the Quit India Movement, and those soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj, who attained martyrdom, among many others.
He said that this was the first attempt at compiling the names of martyrs on this scale.
He appreciated all those involved with the compilation, and the effort behind it.
The Prime Minister asserted that a nation that does not honour and remember those who created, or are an important part, of its history, often does not have a secure future.
In that sense, he added that this effort, is not just a way to cherish the past, but is also a way to secure the future.
He said that youth should especially be made aware of this effort.
The Prime Minister said that the effort of the Union Government is to nurture and recall the brave deeds of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
He said this has a positive influence on the future generations, and inspires them to think of “India First.”
The Prime Minister said that India, so far, did not have a war memorial since independence.
He said that recently, he dedicated the National War Memorial, or Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, to the nation.
Similarly, he said the National Police Memorial has also been built.
He also mentioned the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
He said that in memory of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Azad Hind Fauj, the Kranti Mandir has been established at Red Fort.
He said museums are also being built to commemorate the brave deeds of the Adivasi heroes who were part of our freedom struggle.
The Union Minister of State for Culture (I/C) Dr. Mahesh Sharma was present on the occasion.
