His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, the Religious Head of the Dawoodi Bohra Community, called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in Mumbai today.
The Prime Minister recalled his long and warm association with Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, the former Religious Head of the Dawoodi Bohra Community, who had passed away last year.
His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin appreciated the Prime Minister’s efforts to take India forward, and pledged the community’s support to his initiatives.
The Prime Minister suggested that the Dawoodi Bohra community, which is present in about 400 districts of the country, should initiate Swachhta Abhiyaan competitions among schools in these districts, and award the best performing schools through the creation of laboratories or computer resources.
The Dawoodi Bohra community, which was traditionally a trading community, but has now made great progress in the manufacturing sector, also pledged its support to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Prime Minister.
The Dawoodi Bohra community has expressed keenness to establish a smart city in Mumbai.
The Prime Minister offered all support in this initiative.
The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, who was present on the occasion, also assured all support to the venture.
The Prime Minister also asked for suggestions from the Dawoodi Bohra community for the forthcoming Union Budget, given their vast experience, particularly in bringing about positive results in the health and education sector.
The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Vidyasagar Rao, was also present on the occasion.
