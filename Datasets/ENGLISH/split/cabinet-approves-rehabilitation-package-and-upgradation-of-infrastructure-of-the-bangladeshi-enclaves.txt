The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the rehabilitation package and upgradation of infrastructure of the Bangladeshi enclaves and Cooch Behar district after transfer of enclaves between India and Bangladesh.
The total financial implication for implementation of various components is around Rs. 1005.99 crores.
This includes Rs. 898.50 crores as the fixed cost of strengthening and creation of infrastructure in Cooch Behar district and Bangladesh enclaves in India.
Besides, a variable cost of Rs. 107.49 crores is likely to be incurred for the rehabilitation.
The actual variable cost would depend upon the actual number of families returning to India.
All the works will be implemented by the State Government or its agencies in a time-frame of 3-5 years, and funds would be released by the Ministry of Home Affairs to the State Government as grant-in-aid.
The rehabilitation package and upgradation of infrastructure of the Bangladeshi enclaves and Cooch Behar district after transfer of enclaves between India and Bangladesh follows the two proposals received from the Government of West Bengal.
The rehabilitation measures such as infrastructure development and rehabilitation assistance will help seamless integration of areas and people.
