The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will interact with IT and electronic manufacturing professionals across India on October 24, 2018, on the occasion of the launch of the “Main Nahin Hum” Portal and App.
The portal, which works on the theme “Self4Society”, will enable IT professionals and organizations to bring together their efforts towards social causes, and service to society, on one platform.
In doing so, the portal is expected to help catalyse greater collaboration towards the service of the weaker sections of society, especially by leveraging the benefits of technology.
It is also expected to generate wider participation of interested people who are motivated to work for the benefit of society.
The Prime Minister will meet with key industry leaders.
He will address a gathering consisting of IT professionals, and employees of IT and electronic manufacturing organizations.
He will interact with the gathering in a townhall style format.
