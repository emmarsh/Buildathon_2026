Looking forward to visiting Mizoram and Meghalaya tomorrow, where various development projects will be inaugurated.
These projects will add impetus to the development journey of the Northeast.

Giving wings to our Yuva Shakti, DoNER has set up a Rs. 100 crore Northeast Venture Capital Fund.
Tomorrow I will be distributing cheques to entrepreneurs from this fund.
A spirit of enterprise among the Northeast’s youth augurs well for the empowerment of the region.
In Shillong I will inaugurate the Shillong-Nongstoin-Rongjeng-Tura Road.
This project will improve connectivity and further economic growth.
