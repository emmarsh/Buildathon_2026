A group of about 30 “solar mamas” from Tanzania and a few other African countries demonstrated their skills in fabrication, repair and maintenance of solar lanterns and household lighting systems to the Prime Minister today.
They also presented their honey-extraction and stitching practices and sung a song “we shall overcome”.
Barefoot College, Tilonia (Rajasthan) has been promoting and training rural women solar engineers (solar mamas) from Africa in fabrication, installation, use, repair and maintenance of solar lanterns and household solar lighting under Government of India supported programmes.
They have set up a Barefoot women vocational training college in Zanzibar Islands of Tanzania and other countries in Africa for imparting solar electrification skills (training) and distributing solar kits to trainees.
These colleges also support various entrepreneurial skills such as bee-keeping, tailoring, etc.
The solar mamas have fabricated and installed solar kits, and now maintain these solar electrification systems in their communities.
