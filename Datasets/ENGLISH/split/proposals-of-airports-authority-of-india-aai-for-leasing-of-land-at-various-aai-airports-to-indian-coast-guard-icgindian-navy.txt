The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today approved the leasing of Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) land to Indian Coast Guard (ICG)/Indian Navy (Ministry of Defence) at various airports as under:-
(i). Leasing of land measuring 6200 Sqm. which includes 4800 Sqm. of land for 2 Hangars with apron and 1400 Sqm. of land for Link Taxi Track to the Hangar to ICG at Juhu Airport.
(ii). Leasing of 5 acres of AAI land to Indian Coast Guard at Vizag Airport.
(iii). Leasing of 0.9 acres of AAI land to Indian Coast Guard to facilitate them to construct taxi track at Tuticorin Airport.
(iv). Leasing of triangular piece of AAI land measuring 7326 Sqm. to Indian Coast Guard at Porbandar Airport.
(v). Leasing of 4.62 acres of AAI land to Indian Navy at Porbandar Airport.
Owing to the illegal/terrorist activities via/along the Indian Coast Line, the ICG is developing/establishing various facilities along the coastal line to keep a watch with a view to stop such activities.
To facilitate ICG for establishing various facilities for surveillance of coast line, the said land at above airports is necessary to be transferred to ICG, as demanded by ICG.
Since the land is required for Defence purposes and is in national interest and also has not been falling in the near future Master Plan of the airport, it can be spared for allotment to ICG.
The leasing of the requisite land at proposed airports will facilitate Indian Coast Guard/Indian Navy to establish various facilities for better surveillance of coast line.
Further, it can accrue some revenue for unutilized land of AAI.
