The Metro will make this more convenient, he added.
Shri Narendra Modi said that there is a direct link between connectivity and development.
He said the Metro will mean more employment opportunities for the people in the area.
The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought out a policy relating to Metros, to bring uniformity and standardization in metro rail networks across the country.
He said the objective is to build convenient, comfortable and affordable urban transport systems in our cities.
He said that the aim is also to boost “Make in India” by making metro rail coaches in India itself.
The Prime Minister said that the process of making Metro systems is also linked to cooperative federalism.
Wherever Metros are being built in India, the Centre and the respective State Governments are working together, he added.
Noting that New India requires new and smart infrastructure, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working on roads, railways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways.
