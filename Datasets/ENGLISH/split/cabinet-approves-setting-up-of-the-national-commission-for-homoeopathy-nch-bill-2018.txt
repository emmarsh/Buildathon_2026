The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the draft National Commission for Homoeopathy, Bill, 2018, which seeks to replace the existing regulator Central Council for Homoeopathy (CCH) with a new body to ensure transparency.

The Board of assessment and rating to assess and grant permission to educational institutions of Homoeopathy and Board of ethics and registration of practitioners of Homoeopathy to maintain National Register and ethical issues relating to practice are under the National Commission forHomoeopathy.
It also proposes a common entrance exam and an exit exam which all graduates will have to clear to get practicing licenses.
Further, a teacher’s eligibility test has been proposed to assess the standard of teachers before appointment and promotions.
It further aims at bringing reforms in the medical education of Homoeopathy in lines with the National Medical Commission proposed for setting up for Allopathy system of medicine.
The CCH had been earlier superseded by Board of Governors through an Ordinance and subsequent amendment of Act.
