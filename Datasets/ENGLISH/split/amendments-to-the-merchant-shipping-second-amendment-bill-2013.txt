The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today approved the proposal of the Ministry of Shipping for introducing official amendments to the Merchant Shipping (Second Amendment) Bill, 2013.
The amendments incorporate the recommendations of the department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee, and for ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) after enactment of the Bill.
There are no financial implications.
By ratifying the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, around 1.25 lakh serving Indian national seafarers may stand to benefit from its conducive provisions.
Ships will need to comply with the Convention through holding a Maritime Labour Certificate.
Indian flag merchant vessels of 500 gross tonnage or more and engaged in international voyages will be issued a Maritime Labour Certificate after an inspection of the ship concerned.
This will enable them to receive preferential treatment and exemption from inspection, for this purpose, at foreign ports.
Besides, India will be able to ensure that-all foreign flag vessels entering Indian territorial waters or maritime areas over which India has jurisdiction are subject to an inspection under the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 and ensure that rights of all seafarers (regardless of their nationality) are protected.
The Maritime Labour Convention seeks to provide for safe and secure workplace on a ship, fair terms of employment, decent working and living conditions on ship and rights to health protection, medical care and other social protection in line with the provisions of the International Labour Organization Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (No. 186).
