Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the environment had been a topic of discussion for long, but in recent times, the impact of damage to the environment is being felt by the common man.
The Prime Minister recalled the recent CoP-21 Summit at Paris, and talked about two significant initiatives taken there.
One of these was “Mission Innovation,” launched jointly by US, France and India, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to work towards development of green technologies.
The other was the creation of the International Solar Alliance of countries blessed with abundant sunlight.
The Headquarters of this alliance will be in Delhi, the Prime Minister said.
