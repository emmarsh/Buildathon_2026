Accordingly, the next of kin of those who lost their lives in various parts of the country due to the earthquake on 25th April, shall receive an enhanced compensation of Rs. 4 lakh from the National Disaster Relief Fund.
This is in addition to the compensation of Rs. 2 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.
It implies that the next of kin of those who perished in the tragedy will now receive a total compensation of Rs. 6 lakh.
In addition to these measures, a compensation of Rs. 50,000 from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund has also been announced for those who were seriously injured in the earthquake.
