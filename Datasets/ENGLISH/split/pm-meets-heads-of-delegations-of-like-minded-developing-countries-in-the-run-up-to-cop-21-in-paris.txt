In the run-up to COP-21, the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, scheduled later this year, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today met the Heads of Delegations of Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) in New Delhi.
India has hosted a meeting of the LMDCs over the last two days.
Interacting with the delegates, the Prime Minister emphasized that the world, which is now well aware of the challenge of climate change, also needs to be made aware about the principle of climate justice.
He said there is a need to counter the atmosphere being created by certain groups, including in developing countries, that development and growth are enemies of the environment – and all those who pursue development and growth are therefore guilty.
He said that the world needs to be convinced that developing countries are not enemies of environment.
The Prime Minister suggested that there should be a common school syllabus on environmental subjects across the world, both in developed and developing countries, so that the younger generation grows up with common goals in the battle against climate change.
The Prime Minister laid emphasis on the need for the developed world to fulfil its commitments with regard to sharing clean technology, and providing financial assistance to help the developing world combat climate change, while simultaneously meeting its legitimate development aspirations.
He said that while the developed countries should have targets for emission cuts, developing countries should work on targets of encouragement, such as initiatives towards renewable energy and green buildings.
The Prime Minister called for a change in lifestyle to reduce energy consumption.
He said India stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the LMDCs on climate issues.
The Union Minister for Environment and Forests, Shri Prakash Javedekar, was present during the interaction.
