Senior CEOs from the Republic of Korea today called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
They are currently in New Delhi for the Indo-Korea Business Summit.
The CEOs discussed possibilities of enhancing business cooperation between the two countries.
The Prime Minister appreciated the ethics and professionalism of Korean industry, which had made Korean brands household names in India.
The Prime Minister invited Korean companies to enhance their investments in India, and to “Make in India,” which would also imply “Make for India.”
He suggested that major Korean companies can plan to invest as a group in a region of India, similar to the pattern they follow in Korea.
