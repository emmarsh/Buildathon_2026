PM: India makes transformation from a country worried about its “brain-drain,” to a country that thinks of “brain-gain.”
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said India had made the transformation from a country worried about its “brain-drain,” to a country that thinks of “brain-gain.”
Inaugurating the first Global Exhibition on Services in New Delhi today, the Prime Minister said India should assess its “service” capabilities in the global perspective.
He said India had vast potential to meet the skilled manpower needs of the entire world, and called for a careful mapping of global needs, which India could fulfil over the next decade.
Stating that Human Resource is India’s biggest asset, the Prime Minister said India’s development journey should focus on the 65 percent of its population which is below the age of 35.
He said that as the world looked for skilled manpower, India had the capability to become a crucial provider of this resource.
The Prime Minister mentioned sectors such as nursing, high-end financial services, arbitration, tourism, music and vegetarian cooking as examples of what India had to offer to the world, besides the already established IT and other core sectors.
