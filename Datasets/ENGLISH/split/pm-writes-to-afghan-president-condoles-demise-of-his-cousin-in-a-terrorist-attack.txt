The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has written to the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Hamid Karzai, condoling the demise of his cousin, Mr. Hashmat Karzai, in a terrorist attack.
In his letter, the Prime Minister said, “incidents such as this only deepen our conviction that terrorism remains the main threat to peace and security in Afghanistan.”
He also said such incidents demonstrate that brave Afghans who oppose the menace of terrorism and its use as an instrument of state policy are being targeted systematically.
“I know that you will remain a steadfast bulwark in the face of these challenges and continue to work to deliver a better future to Afghanistan,” the Prime Minister wrote to President Karzai, adding that India would remain a constant partner in this endeavour.
The Prime Minister has also sent his condolences to the family of Mr. Hashmat Karzai.
