Following is the text of English rendering of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement to media outside Parliament House:
“The people of India have voted in unprecedented numbers, blessed their representatives and elected the sixteenth Lok Sabha.
Today is its first day.
I assure the people of this country that in this temple of democracy, every effort will be made to meet the hopes and aspirations of the common man of India.
My best wishes to fellow Indians.”
