The Prime Minister expressed serious concern over the issue of “call drops” and asked officials as to what steps were being taken to address this problem, which, he said, directly affects the common man.
He directed that steps be taken urgently to resolve the problem, and also to ensure that the problems in voice connectivity do not extend to data connectivity in the future.
The Prime Minister reviewed the progress of solar energy related projects, especially with regard to railway stations and airports.
He directed that work related to setting up of Railway Universities be speeded up.
He also called for priority to be assigned to road links with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
