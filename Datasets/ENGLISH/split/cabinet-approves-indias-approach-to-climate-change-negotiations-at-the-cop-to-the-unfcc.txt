The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to India’s approach to Climate Change Negotiations at the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), held in Marrakesh, Morocco during November 7-18, 2016.
Approval to India’s Approach to Climate Change Negotiations at the COP is intended to safeguard the interest of poor and vulnerable groups by emphasizing on adaptation, loss and damage, and protecting the development space.
It incorporates the interest of all strata of society in the country.
Growth and development of a country are linked with Greenhouse Gas emissions.
While combating the ill-effects of climate change, the development space for India and developing countries needs to be preserved.
The approach outlined in the note enables the achievement of this goal and also seeks to address the adaptation needs of the country.
