The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave away the Ramnath Goenka Awards for excellence in journalism.
Speaking on the occasion, he said that during the freedom struggle, newspapers became a very strong medium of expression.
He added that the colonial rulers were scared of those who wrote and expressed themselves through the papers.
Praising Late Shri Ramnath Goenka, the Prime Minister said that there were few in the media who challenged the Emergency and this was led by Ramnath ji.
The Prime Minister said technology poses a challenge to the media, and news that could earlier be disseminated in 24 hours now happens in 24 seconds.
