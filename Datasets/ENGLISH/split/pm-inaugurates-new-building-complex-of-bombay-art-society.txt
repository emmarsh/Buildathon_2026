Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today unveiled a plaque to mark the inauguration of the new building complex of the Bombay Art Society.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister remarked that rarely has an institution left its imprint on three centuries.
He added that the Bombay Art Society has managed to do so, right from its inception in the late nineteenth century.
He said that the reason for this is that art has its own strength and message.
The Prime Minister emphasized that art is not just an adornment for walls, but a pillar of strength for society.
He said art can play a key role in all-round personality development of children.
He said art helps in keeping the human spirit alive in individuals, even in this machine age.
The Prime Minister said art should never be dependent on the establishment, but it should definitely be patronised by the establishment.
Elaborating on the letters A, R, and T, that make up the word “art”, the Prime Minister said that they stand for the qualities of agelessness, racelessness, regionlessness, and timelessness – all of which define art.
The Prime Minister suggested that digital technology can be used to document the process of creation of a work of art, and this could help people comprehend the thought process of the artist.
