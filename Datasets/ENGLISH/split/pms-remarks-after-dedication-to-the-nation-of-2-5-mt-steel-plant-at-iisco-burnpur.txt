The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today described the Union Government and 29 State Governments as 30 pillars of “TEAM INDIA” which would take India forward.
Addressing a large public meeting at Burnpur after dedicating to the Nation the 2.5 MT modernized and expanded IISCO steel plant at Burnpur, the Prime Minister mentioned various instances of cooperative federalism of recent months, including the setting up of the NITI Aayog, and the devolution of additional revenues to the States through acceptance of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.
“Koi “iisco” kahe, koi usko kahe, lekin aaj ka avsar toh hum sabko garv dene vaala hai,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that the decades old Land Boundary issue between India and Bangladesh had been successfully resolved through the same spirit of Team India, as all state governments and political parties had come together to support the resolution of the issue.
The Prime Minister said it was time for India to address the issue of “geographical imbalance” too along with economic and social imbalance.
He said that eastern India too should develop as fast as western India is developing, and for that, development of Bengal is essential.
The Prime Minister said “District Mineral Foundations” would be set up to help speed up progress and welfare of the poor in the mineral-rich districts.
He said that within a year, the atmosphere of gloom has lifted, and all global rating agencies now agree that India is among the world’s fastest growing economies.
