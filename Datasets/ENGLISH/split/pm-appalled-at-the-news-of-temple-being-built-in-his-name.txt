Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said that he is appalled at the news of a Temple being built in his name.
“Have seen the news about a Temple being built in my name.
I was appalled.
This is shocking and against India`s great traditions.
Building such Temples is not what our culture teaches us.
Personally, it made me very sad.
Would urge those doing it not to do it.
If you have time and resources, please devote the same towards fulfilling our dream of a Clean India,” the Prime Minister said.
