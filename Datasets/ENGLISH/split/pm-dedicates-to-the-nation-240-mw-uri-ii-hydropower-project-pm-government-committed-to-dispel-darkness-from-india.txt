Prime Minister Narendra Modi today dedicated to the nation the 240 MW Uri-II hydropower project built by NHPC at a cost of Rs. 2290 crore in Jammu and Kashmir.
Addressing people at the project site, Shri Modi said his Government is committed to dispel darkness from the country.
He said this project was conceived during the Government of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and we have fulfilled that vision.
He said the country has hydropower potential of 1.5 lakh MW, but we have not been able to harness much of it so far.
Today, when global warming is an issue that affects all mankind, we will place maximum emphasis on renewable energy sources.
Our objective is to tap maximum hydropower potential, the Prime Minister added.
He said power is an essential requirement for development and economic growth.
The entire economy of Jammu and Kashmir will gain momentum from hydropower projects, he said.
Giving the example of Bhutan, he said the economy of that country was now being built around hydropower.
The Prime Minister said sufficient emphasis had not been given to power transmission lines network, and his Government will take this task forward through the PPP model.
The Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri N.N. Vohra, The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Omar Abdullah, and MoS(I/C) Power Shri Piyush Goel were present on the occasion.
