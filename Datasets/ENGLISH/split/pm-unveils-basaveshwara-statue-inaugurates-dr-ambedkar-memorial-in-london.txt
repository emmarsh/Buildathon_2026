Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said he was deeply pained by the terror attacks in Paris yesterday.
He said this was not just an attack on the people of France, but on all of humanity, and the time had come for all humanitarian forces from across the world to unite to fight this global menace.

The Prime Minister described Basaveshwara as a great philosopher and social reformer, who had fought against social evils of his time, and worked for the strengthening of democracy at the grassroots.

He lit a candle in front of Dr. Ambedkar’s bust.
