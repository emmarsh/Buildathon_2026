“We mark 40 years of one of India’s darkest periods- the Emergency, when the then political leadership trampled over our democracy.
Inspired by the call of JP, several men and women across India selflessly immersed themselves in the movement to safeguard our democracy.
We are very proud of the lakhs of people, who resisted the Emergency and whose efforts ensured that our democratic fabric is preserved.
Personally, the Emergency brings back many memories.
As youngsters, we learnt a lot during the anti-Emergency movement.
Emergency was a great opportunity to work with a wide spectrum of leaders and organisations fighting for the same goal- return of democracy.
A vibrant liberal democracy is the key to progress.
Let us do everything possible to further strengthen our democratic ideals and ethos.”
