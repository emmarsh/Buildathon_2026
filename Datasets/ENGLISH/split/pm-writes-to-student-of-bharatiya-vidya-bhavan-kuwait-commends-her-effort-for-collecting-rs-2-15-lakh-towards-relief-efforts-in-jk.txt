Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in a letter of appreciation to Miss Duvvuri Rohini Pratyusha, a 16-year old, Class XII student of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Kuwait, commended her effort for collecting Rs. 2.15 lakhs towards the relief and rehabilitation efforts in Jammu and Kashmir.
Miss Pratyusha collected the amount by reaching out to Indian families after school hours and handed over the money to the Embassy of India in Kuwait to be sent to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.
Stating that there is no cause greater and nobler than helping others, especially those caught in a moment of great adversity, Prime Minister appreciated Ms. Pratyusha’s leadership, organizational abilities and concern for the victims of the flood.
