The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for providing relief to the migrants of the Hilly areas of Jammu division at par with the relief being provided to the Kashmiri migrants involving a total estimated expenditure of Rs. 13.45 Crore per annum.
Terrorist violence/militancy in the State of Jammu & Kashmir, particularly in its early phases (early 1990s), had led to large scale forced migration from the Kashmir Valley.
Besides the families who migrated from the Valley, many families migrated from different hilly areas of Jammu division to safer places of nearby towns due to security reasons.
At present there are about 1054 registered Jammu migrant families.
Presently the State Government of Jammu and Kashmir is providing cash relief of Rs.40Q/- per head per month (maximum Rs.1600/- per family per month), cash assistance of Rs.300 per cattle per month for purchase of fodder, plus dry ration (9 Kg.
Atta, 2 Kg.
Rice per person per month and 10 Litre Kerosene per family per month) to the migrants of the Hilly areas of Jammu division.
The new proposal would enhance the relief being provided to the migrants of the hilly areas of Jammu division at par with the Kashmiri migrants i.e. a cash relief of Rs.2500 per head per month (maximum Rs.10000 per family per month) plus relief for ration/fodder.
The expenditure incurred by the state Government in this regard would now be reimbursed by the Government of India.
