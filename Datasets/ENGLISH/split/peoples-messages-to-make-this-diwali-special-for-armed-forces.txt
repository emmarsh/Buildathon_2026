People’s messages to make this Diwali special for Armed Forces
PM Modi urges citizens to send their messages to jawans
The great respect and admiration that the nation has for our Armed Forces, will find expression this festive season, through a unique campaign being led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The #Sandesh2Soldiers campaign gives every citizen an opportunity to spread happiness and cheer among the Indian Armed Forces, who are guarding our nation’s frontiers, far from their loved ones on Diwali.
A holistic campaign has been launched to urge and invite people to send letters and messages to the Armed Forces.
Leading this effort, the Prime Minister shared through social media, a special video, featuring his appeal to the people to send messages to our brave Armed Forces personnel.
Within hours, the video has generated tremendous interest on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
People can send messages to soldiers on the Narendra Modi App, through MyGov.in, and also through All India Radio.
Doordarshan shall also be mounting a programme to share people’s emotions with the Armed Forces.
A special module has been launched on the Narendra Modi App, which enables people to send greetings or their hand-written messages to the Armed Forces.
The #Sandesh2Soldiers campaign is expected to generate increased interaction between the people and the Armed Forces.
Earlier this month, at an event in Bhopal, the Prime Minister had focused on the human element of our brave jawans.
His appeal to people to applaud jawans when they meet them, has also created a buzz on social media.
Since becoming Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has spent both Diwalis with the Armed Forces.
