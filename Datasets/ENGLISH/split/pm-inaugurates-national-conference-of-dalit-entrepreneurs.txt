The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the National Conference of Dalit Entrepreneurs at Vigyan Bhawan, organized by the Dalit Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DICCI) in New Delhi.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled one of his “Mann Ki Baat” programmes, where he had exhorted people to talk not just about their rights, but also about their duties.
The Prime Minister said that this gathering of Dalit Entrepreneurs is one which has not just talked about their duties, but has successfully fulfilled duties.
Paying tribute to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Prime Minister said that while Dr. Ambedkar is widely hailed as the architect of our Constitution, he was also a great economist.
He spoke of Dr. Ambedkar’s vision of industrialization in India, saying that Dalits, who had no land of their own, could only progress through industrialization.
The Prime Minister said financial inclusion is at the core of the Union Government’s focus, which is to create job-creators, not job-seekers.
In this context, he mentioned the loans being given under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He also mentioned the Venture Capital Fund for First Generation Entrepreneurs.
The Prime Minister assured the Dalit Entrepreneurs that the Government is working for their benefit.
He said the successes of the members of the gathering today, could inspire anyone who faces adversity.
The Prime Minister presented five business excellence awards to Dalit entrepreneurs.
Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, was present on the occasion.
