Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Shyamji Krishna Varma on his birth anniversary and urged people to visit Kranti Teerth, a memorial that celebrates Shyamji Krishna Varma`s life and contribution.
“On his birth anniversary, I bow to Shyamji Krishna Varma.
A devout patriot, he inspired several nationalists, both in India and overseas.
Shyamji Krishna Varma was closely associated with India House, which was a very active hub for the nationalist movement in London.
In 2003, I had the honour to bring Shyamji Krishna Varma`s ashes back to India from Switzerland.
In 2010, we dedicated Kranti Teerth to the nation.
Kranti Teerth is a memorial that celebrates Shyamji Krishna Varma`s life and contribution.
I urge you to visit Kranti Teerth in Mandvi (Kutch district).
Visit, get inspired by the life of Shyamji Krishna Varma!”, the Prime Minister said.
