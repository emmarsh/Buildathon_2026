He also interacted with young students.
He was given a presentation of a special robot called “AgBot” which has agricultural applications.
Writing on the AgBot, the Prime Minister said research is the mother of development, and is intrinsically linked to the development journey of mankind.
He said agriculture would benefit from the use of science and technology.
He congratulated the scientists at QUT and wished them well.
The Prime Minister was also given a presentation on the Integrated Biofuels Project, under which cutting-edge, collaborative research is being carried out as part of the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund Grand Challenge Initiative.
