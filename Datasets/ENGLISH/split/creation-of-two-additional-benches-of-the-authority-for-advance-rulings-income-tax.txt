Background
In order to provide the facility of ascertaining the Income-tax liability of a non¬resident/ to plan their Income-tax affairs well in advance and to avoid long drawn and expensive litigation, a scheme of Advance Rulings was introduced under the Income-Tax Act, 1961 and the Authority for Advance Rulings was constituted.
A non-resident or certain categories of resident can obtain binding rulings from the Authority on question of law or fact arising out of any transaction/proposed transactions which are relevant for the determination of his tax liability.
In order to enable resident taxpayers to obtain an advance ruling in respect of their income tax liability above a defined threshold, it has been decided to strengthen the Authority for Advance Rulings by constituting additional benches.
