The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved an exemption from charging commercial rates at the time of acquisition for the plot No. 31-B, measuring 2800 sq.meter in Chanakyapuri, Diplomatic Area to the Fijian High Commission in New Delhi and to extend the same terms and conditions as offered by Fiji for the land offered to the High Commission of India in Suva, Fiji.
Background:
In August 2015, Government of Fiji offered a plot of land measuring 6695 sq.meters at a special lease of 99 year period with a rent of FJ $ 100 per annum to be assessed every 5 years for construction of the High Commission of India in Suva, Fiji and proposed exchange of land on reciprocal basis.
