The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the National Rurban Mission from Kurubhat, in Rajnandgaon district of Chhattisgarh.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister described the Rurban Mission as one which would enable cluster based development – with a “rural soul and urban amenities.”
He said this scheme would complement the Smart Cities initiative by creating Smart Villages.
The Prime Minister described Rurban clusters as centres of economic activity, which would spur growth, and improve the quality of life in nearby villages.
The Prime Minister said the country is taking a new direction of development.
He said one example of this was that the important Rurban mission was being launched not from New Delhi, but from Kurubhat, in Rajnandgaon district of Chhattisgarh.
He said that Government was now being brought to the doorstep of the villages and the tribal communities.
The Prime Minister congratulated villages and communities of nearby areas for achieving Open Defecation Free status.
Earlier, the Prime Minister visited an exhibition at the venue, which showcased the implementation of development schemes, and handicrafts.
