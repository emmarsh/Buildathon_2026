Background:
Anomalies existed in the pay scales of Executives of NHPC, NEEPCO, THDCIL and SJVNL w.e.f.
01.01.1997 due to revision of pay scales of unionized category of workmen/non-executives in line with the NTPC/Oil sector within the organizations.
The pay scales of workmen and Supervisors were higher than the pay scale of Executives in the E-1 grade.
The proposal was earlier considered by the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) and the Cabinet on several occasion.
The Cabinet in December, 2013 decided as below:
The deviant pay scales fixed w.e.f.
01.01.1997 shall not be regularized.
However, no recovery shall be made for the excess pay drawn from 01.01,1997onwards considering the difficulties in effecting recovery and also considering thatsuch a recovery may de-motivate the staff.
The pay scales shall be fitted w.e.f.
01.01.2007 after correcting the aberration in payscales fixed w.e.f.
01.01.1997.
Aggrieved with the order, various Employee Associations of Hydro PSEs filed Writ Petitions in different High Courts.
The High Court of Uttarakhand&Meghalaya quashed the above decision.
SLP was filed in Supreme Court on-12.04.2017 against the judgment of High Court of Uttarakhand which was dismissed on 08.05.2017.
A Contempt petition has been filed in the High Courts of Meghalaya and Uttarakhand.
Ministry of Power is left with no option other than seeking approval of Cabinet for regularizing the pay scales of NHPC, SJVNL, NEEPCO and THDCIL w.e.f.
01.01.1997 adopted by them consequent upon the orders of Ministry of Power dated 04.04.2006 and 01.09.2006.
