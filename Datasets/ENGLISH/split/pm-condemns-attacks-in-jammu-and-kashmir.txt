The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has condemned the attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.
“Attacks in Jammu and Kashmir are condemnable.
They are desperate attempts to derail the atmosphere of hope & goodwill as seen by increased voter turnout.
125 crore Indians bow to our brave Army men who sacrificed their lives.
These men lived and died for the Nation.
We won’t forget them,” the Prime Minister said.
