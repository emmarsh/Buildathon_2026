PM’s statement on Gearing up for the 3rd India Africa Forum Summit 2015
India is proud to host the 3rd India Africa Forum Summit from 26-29 October 2015 in New Delhi.
This time the level of engagement has been scaled up significantly and we have invited Leaders from all 54 African countries and the African Union.
The Summit is going to be one of the biggest gatherings of African countries outside Africa, which is a reflection of the desire on part of both Africa and India to engage more intensively in our quest for a better future.
India and Africa have a historic relationship based on mutual respect, trust and solidarity.
In recent times, our relationship has witnessed progress and has grown into a mutually beneficial partnership.
India is a major investor in Africa and Indian investments, close to US$ 30 billion, have contributed immensely to job creation in Africa.
As minds meet and hands work together, the IAFS-III could be a landmark event in our journey towards further cementing strong ties between India and Africa.
In the run up to the India Africa Forum Summit, many side events are being organised.
Trade Ministers of India and Africa, accompanied by business delegations, will meet on 23 October 2015.
A business exhibition will be organised at the Summit venue on 27 and 29 October 2015 by leading Indian chambers of commerce and industry.
More than 16000 schools are participating in various competitions organised by CBSE on themes related to India-Africa cooperation.
