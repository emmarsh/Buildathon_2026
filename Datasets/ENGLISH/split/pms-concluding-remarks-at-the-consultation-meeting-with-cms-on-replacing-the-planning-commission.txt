Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, at the conclusion of the consultation meeting with Chief Ministers, said that the meeting was fruitful and all Chief Ministers had offered significant suggestions.
The Prime Minister referred to remarks made by Dr. Manmohan Singh on April 30th, 2014 regarding the Planning Commission.
He said that Dr. Manmohan Singh, who had been associated for a long time with the Planning Commission, had noted that the body has no futuristic vision in the post-reform period.
He had also noted that the Planning Commission would have to reinvent itself to remain more effective and relevant in the present situation.
The Prime Minister also recalled his own speech on Independence Day, and said that the Planning Commission should be replaced by an organization which can think creatively, strengthen the federal structure, and energize states.
