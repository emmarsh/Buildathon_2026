On 3rd October 2014 Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will share his thoughts with the people of India through the radio.
The Prime Minister’s radio programme will be held at 11:00 AM on 3rd October, which is also Vijaya Dashmi.
The Prime Minister is expected to share his thoughts on a variety of issues.
A separate Open Forum has been created on MyGov for citizens to share their comments for the forthcoming radio programme: http://mygov.nic.in/groupissue/pm-on-radio-on-3rd-october-2014-at-1100-am/show
Citizens should share ideas and best practices on development, good governance and other issues.
The Prime Minister would refer to the Open Forum before the programme and may even refer to some of the points made on the Forum.
Earlier, on 6th September 2014 the Prime Minister talked about connecting with people through radio and sought ideas.
Since then there has been an extremely positive feedback on the idea of having a radio programme.
Netizens across India have welcomed this idea.
The Radio programme is seen as one more instance of the Prime Minister innovatively communicating with the people.
Just recently, on 17th September, after two busy and eventful days in Gujarat the Prime Minister spent over an hour personally replying to people who greeted him on his birthday on Twitter.
