The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Indonesia in the field of new and renewable energy.
The MoU was signed in Jakarta last month during Vice President, Shri M. Hamid Ansari’s visit to Indonesia.
The objective of the MoU is to establish the basis for a cooperative institutional framework to encourage and promote technical bilateral cooperation on new and renewable energy issues on the basis of mutual benefit, equality and reciprocity.
The areas of cooperation will focus on capacity building, exchange of scientific and technological information and data, transfer of technology on non-commercial basis, development of joint research or technical projects on subjects of mutual interest, encouragement and promotion of investment, encouragement of policy dialogue and other areas as may be agreed upon by the two countries.
