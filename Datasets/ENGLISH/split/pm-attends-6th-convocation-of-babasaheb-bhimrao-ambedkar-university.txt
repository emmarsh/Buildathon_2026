The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the sixth Convocation of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University at Lucknow.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that on one hand he is happy to see India’s rise in the 21st century, as a nation full of youthful energy, with youthful dreams and youthful resolve.
He said the youth is India’s source of strength.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister recalled the recent suicide committed by a student in Hyderabad, and said he felt and understood the pain of the family.
He said that whatever may have been the reasons, a mother lost her son; indeed Mother India had lost a son.
The Prime Minister said that his Government would follow the path shown by Babasaheb Ambedkar, and work towards creating an environment where problems could be overcome.
The Prime Minister recalled Dr. Ambedkar’s economic vision, and said the Government is working towards the development of youth as job creators, instead of job seekers.
The Prime Minister mentioned how Dr. Ambedkar had placed importance on education, and had achieved so much despite adversity.
He said that Dr. Ambedkar had then resolved to return to India and devote his life for the welfare of the weaker sections of society.
He urged the convocating youth to follow the example set by Dr. Ambedkar, and try to serve the poor and the downtrodden.
The Prime Minister laid the Foundation Stone of the state-of-the-art Student Activity Centre at the University.
