The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for construction and operationalisation of 100 bedded General Hospital at Rural Health Training Centre (RHTC), Najafgarh, New Delhi at an estimated cost of about Rs. 95 Crore.
The Project envisages setting up of the 100 bedded hospital in Najafgarh in two years to cater to the local population of 13.65 Lakh spread across 73 villages.
The hospital will include four major clinical services in Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Paediatrics and Surgery, including a blood bank, diagnostic services and separate Out Patient Departments (OPD) for General Medicine, Surgery, Dental, ENT, Ophthalmology, audiometry and paediatric care through a staff of more than 30 doctors and 40 nurses, apart from 50 Allied and Healthcare staff.
This hospital will address a long-standing healthcare access issue for the local population, especially for the vulnerable sections including women and children.
It will provide child and maternal services, trauma care and basic primary diagnostic, therapeutic, preventive and curative services in the area.
The hospital is expected to be fully operational by May 2020 along with all departments and requisite human resources.
