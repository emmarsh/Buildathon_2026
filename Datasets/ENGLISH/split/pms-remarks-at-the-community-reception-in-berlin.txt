Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said the time is right for India to emerge as a global manufacturing hub.
In his remarks at the Community Reception in Berlin, the Prime Minister said that the Information Technology revolution had made the world take notice of India’s youth power.
He urged young professionals in Germany to act as a bridge between India and Germany, especially since Germany was a world leader in manufacturing.
The Prime Minister said India needs the right environment for young talent to prosper.
He said events like the Hannover Fair, where India is a partner country this year, are opportunities for India to both showcase its capabilities, and to learn from the work others were doing.
He added that such events help us gear up to face new challenges.
He said India must aim to become a “zero-defect, zero effect” low-cost manufacturing hub.
On the subject of global warming, the Prime Minister said India must set the agenda for the forthcoming UN climate change conference in Paris.
He said respect for nature is inherent in the Indian ethos.
The Prime Minister called for balanced growth in the Indian economy, with equal emphasis on agriculture, manufacturing and services.
