Relations between India and Canada have made remarkable progress in recent years and were elevated to the level of strategic partnership during my visit.
Canada has emerged as an important and reliable partner in India’s socio-economic transformation.
Our partnership is not only blessed with enormous potential for mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation across a wide range of areas, it can also help shape a more peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.

I take this opportunity to once again extend a cordial invitation to you and your family to pay an official visit to India.
I look forward to welcoming you in New Delhi.
