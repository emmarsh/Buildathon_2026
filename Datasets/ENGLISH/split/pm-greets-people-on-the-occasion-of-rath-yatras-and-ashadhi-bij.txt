“My warm greetings to the people on the occasion of the Rath Yatras that would be held across India today.
We bow to Lord Jagannath on this auspicious day.
Today once again he sets out on his chariot, giving blessings to the people.
We pray to Lord Jagannath for peace, prosperity & happiness in India.
May Lord Jagannath bless us with good monsoon that will help farmers.
As Gujarat CM I had the honour to perform the Pahind Vidhi ritual during the Yatra in Ahmedabad.
It is an experience I really cherished.
My greetings on Ashadhi Bij, the Kutchi New Year.
I pray for a year filled with joy & happiness.”
