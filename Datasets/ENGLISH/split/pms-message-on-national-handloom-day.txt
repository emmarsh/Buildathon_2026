Following is the text of Prime Minister’s message on National Handloom Day:
“On National Handloom Day, let us affirm that we will give an impetus to the handloom sector and use more handloom products in our daily lives.
Our handloom sector is diverse, eco friendly and is a source of employment for countless weavers, who will be very encouraged by our support.
Since there are many women associated with the handloom sector, growth of the handloom sector is an important means of women empowerment also.”
