The Prime Minister has directed the Cabinet Secretary Shri Ajit Seth, and OSD in the Cabinet Secretariat Shri P. K. Sinha to personally review the figures being reported from various parts in the country, so that any bottlenecks in the full implementation of the vision of “Swachh Vidyalaya” initiative can be removed expeditiously.
