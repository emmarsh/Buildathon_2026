The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Myanmar for the conservation of earthquake-damaged pagodas at Bagan, Myanmar.
The MoU will be signed during the visit of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to Myanmar during 6-7 September 2017.
Implementation of the project will further strengthen India’s enduring ties in culture and religion with Myanmar.
It will also generate immense goodwill for India among the people of Myanmar due to the religious significance as well as the touristic significance of the project.
It will also contribute to India’s development partnership with Myanmar.
Bagan is one of the premier tourist attractions of Myanmar.
It will be an opportunity to showcase India’s expertise in the restoration and conservation of monuments not only to the people of Myanmar but also to the tourists from other countries.
