The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today recalled the immortal words of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who, in a speech in Parliament on 6th December 1971, had said that the friendship between India and Bangladesh was like a bond which would not break under any pressure, and would never be the victim of any diplomacy.
He said this message of Shri Vajpayee had to be passed on to succeeding generations.
In his acceptance speech, after the conferment of the Bangladesh liberation war honour on Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Shri Narendra Modi described Shri Vajpayee as a far-sighted leader, who had said that history was being rewritten, as the blood of Indian soldiers flowed together with the Mukti Jodhas, for the liberation of Bangladesh.
The Prime Minister said that it would have been wonderful if Shri Vajpayee had been present to receive this honour himself.
He expressed hope that Shri Vajpayee would soon become well, and guide everyone once again.
The Prime Minister said that though he had entered politics quite late, he had been one of the many youth activists who had come to Delhi in response to Shri Vajpayee’s call for Satyagraha for the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971.
He described himself as one of the crores who wanted this vision to be realized.
