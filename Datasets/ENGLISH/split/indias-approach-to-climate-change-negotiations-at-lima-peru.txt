The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for the negotiating position for the 20th Conference of Parties (COP-20) on climate change scheduled to be held from 1 to 12 December, 2014 at Lima, Peru.
CoP-20 is expected to focus on the elements of 2015 Agreement and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).
The approach seeks to protect the interests of the country in climate change negotiations based on the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and it’s Kyoto Protocol (KP).
It would also enhance the solidarity among the developing countries on these issues.
