PM exhorts IRS probationers to trust the people
167 probationers of the Indian Revenue Service today called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
Interacting with the probationers, the Prime Minister exhorted them to keep a sense of trust for the people of India, in course of their work.
He said an overwhelming majority of people in the country are law-abiding, and wish to comply with laws in the interest of the nation.
He said the honest taxpayer should not be harassed, even as the officers perform their duty of implementing the Government’s revenue policy.
He added that the officers should ensure that all people-friendly initiatives of the Government reach the people on priority.
Replying to a series of questions from the young officer-trainees, the Prime Minister said that officers must feel that each and every citizen of this country is a part of his family.
He said that if this spirit prevails, the officers will be able to work with vigour and enthusiasm, and even the question of exhaustion will not arise.
In the course of the 45 minute session, the Prime Minister recalled several anecdotes from his life and his political experience, to explain the importance of a sensitive and humane approach, that is required from civil servants.
