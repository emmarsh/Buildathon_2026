The city of Surat is blessed with remarkable determination.
This is a city which believes in harmony.
I urge the citizens of Surat to actively take part in this year’s Yoga Day in June and the ‘Run for Unity’ in October.
Such marathons augur well for the health of people.
I appeal to people to embrace sports.
It brings good health and furthers a spirit of teamwork.
