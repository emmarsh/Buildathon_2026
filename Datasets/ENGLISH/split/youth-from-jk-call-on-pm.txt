Youth from Jammu and Kashmir call on PM
Over 240 youth from Jammu and Kashmir called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today.
They are currently on a visit to Delhi as part of the “Wattan Ko Jano” initiative being carried out by the Ministry of Home Affairs in coordination with the State Government.
The youth, in the age-group of 15 to 24, are mostly from militancy-affected families, orphanages, and weaker sections of society.
The youth interacted with the Prime Minister for over half-an-hour on the lawns of Panchvati at 7, Race Course Road.
In response to their questions, the Prime Minister spoke at length about his vision for the development of India and especially the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
He said the State had immense potential for tourism, which in turn would bring prosperity to people.
He said that the Union Government was working to ensure good physical and digital connectivity across the State.
The Prime Minister spoke at length of his vision for all-round development of the country, including a house for everyone by 2022.
The youth responded enthusiastically to the Prime Minister’s statements and questions.
They repeatedly expressed their wish for the State of Jammu and Kashmir to progress and be developed with modern infrastructure, as they have seen in Delhi.
After the interaction, the Prime Minister invited the youth for high-tea on the Panchvati lawns.
