This is a day to reaffirm our commitment towards further strengthening our democracy by unfailingly participating in democratic processes at the local, state and national levels.
Your doing so will go a long way in building a New India.
I urge people from all walks of life to create awareness on voter registration and especially request my young friends to register themselves as voters if they have not done so already.
Every vote cast enhances our democratic fabric”.
