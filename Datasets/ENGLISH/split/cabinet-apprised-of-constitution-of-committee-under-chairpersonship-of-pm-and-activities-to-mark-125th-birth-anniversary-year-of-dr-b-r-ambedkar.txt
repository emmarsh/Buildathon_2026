Background:-
This year marks the 125th Birth Anniversary year of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.
The contribution of Dr. Ambedkar in social, political and economic sectors is enormous and he is one of the key founders of Modern India.
The life of Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration to millions.
Growing up in a very challenging environment and having faced many difficulties in childhood, Dr. Ambedkar completed his higher education in best universities of the world, only due to his sheer determination, tremendous hard work and humility.
He is known as the architect of Constitution of India.
The hard work done by him in the drafting of the Constitution, made it a powerful tool for social and economic empowerment of the downtrodden, which is praiseworthy.
Dr. Ambedkar ensured that there are appropriate checks and balances in the democratic system of Government and ensured that the three wings of the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary, function independently with accountability to one another.
