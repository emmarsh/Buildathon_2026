The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Model Agreement on exemption from visa requirements for the holders of diplomatic and official passports.
This would facilitate visa-free entry, transit and stay up to 90 days (or less) in any period of 180 days (or more) in the territory of India or signatory country for holders of diplomatic and official passports of either country.
This is part of India’s ongoing efforts to expand the envelope of visa-free travel for holders of diplomatic and official passports to other countries of the world, visa free Agreements have been signed with 69 countries.
There are still more than 130 countries with which India is yet to enter into or sign similar Agreements.
