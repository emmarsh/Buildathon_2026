The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been appraised of the Implementing Arrangement (IA) for Pre-formulation Studies of a Maritime Domain Awareness Mission signed between India and France on 10th March 2018.
The proposed joint mission will be devoted to maritime domain awareness, with the objective to provide relevant data and services to both nations.
The objective is to monitor the maritime traffic and to identify the non-compliant ships at the maximum possible revisit frequency.
The monitoring system would provide an end to end solution for detection, identification, monitoring of vessels in the regions of interest for India and France.
As per the IA, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Centre Nationale Dètudes Spatiales (CNES), France will jointly undertake various activities during these pre-formulation studies and present the pre-formulation concept study results to the respective senior management for review within one year of its signing.
