• Recalling all our previous declarations, we emphasise the importance of further strengthening BRICS solidarity and cooperation based on our common interests and key priorities to further strengthen our strategic partnership in the spirit ofopenness, solidarity,equality, mutual understanding, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation.
We agree that emerging challenges to global peace and security and to sustainable development require further enhancing of our collective efforts.
• We agree that BRICS countries represent an influential voice on the global stage through our tangible cooperation, which delivers direct benefits to our people.
In this context, we note with satisfaction the operationalisation of the New Development Bank (NDB) and of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), which contributes greatly to the global economy and the strengthening of the international financial architecture.
We welcome the report presented by NDB President on the work of the Bank during the first year of its operations.
We are pleased to note the progress in operationalising the Africa Regional Centre (ARC) of the NDB and pledge our full support in this regard.
We look forward to developing new BRICS initiatives in a wider range of areas in the years to come.
