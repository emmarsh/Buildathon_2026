The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Canada in the field of Civil Aviation.
MoU will help in deepening the bilateral cooperation and enhancing the experience and technical knowledge in the field of Civil Aviation between India and Canada.
Some of the important features of the MoU would be as under:-
• An appropriate platform shall be formalized for exchange of views on the possibilities of fostering greater commercial/economic cooperation between the two countries in the areas of civil aviation.
• The two countries shall have a cooperation programme in the areas of safety of aircraft operations and related issues that will provide more up-to-date knowledge to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to make it familiar with best international practices and latest International Civil Aviation Organisation’s safety oversight programme requirements.
• Apart from the above, India firms could also be benefited from the exchange of technical knowhow with Canadian companies as the aviation industry is far more developed in Canada.
Reciprocally, Canadian companies could gain from enhanced access to the fast developing civil aviation industry in India.
