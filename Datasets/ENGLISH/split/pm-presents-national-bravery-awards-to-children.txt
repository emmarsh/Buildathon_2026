PM presents National Bravery Awards to children
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the National Bravery Awards to 25 children.
Congratulating the award winners and their parents, the Prime Minister said that the presence of mind, quick thinking, selfless determination, and sensitivity for fellow human beings in distress were the most important elements of the acts of bravery performed by these children.
The Prime Minister added that for the award winners, this act of bravery should not become an end in itself.
He said life must continue to evolve, and the children should continue to develop their career, and continue to serve society to the best of their abilities.
He said that the book – Life progression of ICCW National Bravery Awardees – which he had released today, touched upon these aspects.
The Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt.
Maneka Gandhi, was present on the occasion.
The National Bravery Award Scheme was initiated by the ICCW – Indian Council for Child Welfare – to give due recognition to the children who distinguish themselves by performing outstanding deeds of bravery and meritorious service and to inspire other children to emulate their examples.
