The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the National SC/ST hub, and the Zero Defect, Zero Effect (ZED) scheme for MSMEs at Ludhiana in Punjab.
He also presented National Awards to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).
He distributed 500 traditional wooden charkhas (spinning wheels) among women.
Speaking on the occasion, he said Ludhiana is an important economic centre, and therefore, it is natural to launch a scheme related to MSME from the city.
The Prime Minister said that the MSME sector is crucial for the economic progress of India.
He said MSMEs must match global quality control standards.
Talking about the distribution of charkhas, the Prime Minister said Khadi is a priority for us, and a charkha at home brings more income.
He said Khadi is marketed well now, adding that once upon a time, the apt slogan was ‘Khadi for Nation,’ but now it should be ‘Khadi for Fashion.’
The Prime Minister said that a spirit of entrepreneurship among Dalits will benefit us.
He added that there are youngsters whose dreams are to create enterprises and jobs.
Earlier, the Prime Minister visited Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, where he dedicated to the nation three hydropower projects – namely, Koldam, Parbati and Rampur.
