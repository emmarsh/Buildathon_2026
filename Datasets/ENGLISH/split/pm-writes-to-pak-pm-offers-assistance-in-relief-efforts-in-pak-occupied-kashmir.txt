The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has written to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, offering assistance in the flood relief effort in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.
“It is a matter of great distress that the retreating monsoon rains have played havoc in many parts of our two countries,” the Prime Minister said in his letter, adding that “the devastation caused by the record rains and the consequent flooding is unprecedented.”
“While reviewing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, I was informed that the damage to life and property is equally, if not more, severe in areas across the Line of Control as well.
My heart goes out to the affected people and my deepest sympathies are with them and their families.
In this hour of need, I offer any assistance that you may need in the relief efforts that will be undertaken by the Government of Pakistan.
Our resources are at your disposal wherever you need them,” the Prime Minister wrote.
