35 first-time MLAs from Maharashtra called on Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in Parliament House today.
They were accompanied by the Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Shri Haribhau Bagde.
Highlighting the Union Government’s initiatives towards Cooperative Federalism, the Prime Minister said, States have been allocated 62 per cent of the total resources in the Union Budget, while only 38 per cent have been left for use by the Centre.
He also spoke about the Union Government’s acceptance of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission regarding devolution of 42 per cent of the divisible pool of taxes to States.
He said that the States would also benefit from the proceeds from the coal auctions and the enhanced mineral royalties.
The Prime Minister suggested that these additional funds and resources at the disposal of the States should be primarily directed towards infrastructure building.
