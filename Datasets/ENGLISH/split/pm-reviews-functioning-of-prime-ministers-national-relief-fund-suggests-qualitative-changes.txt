The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the functioning of the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and suggested several qualititative changes in the way the fund is managed.
Referring to the Gujarat model, he directed that the selection of beneficiaries should be done in a more comprehensive, scientific and humanitarian basis, giving priority to children, poor, and cases from Government Hospitals.
Life-threatening diseases should be accorded priority, and cases should be decided on need and merit, the Prime Minister added.
Shri Narendra Modi has directed that pendency in appeals for help should be minimized.
He said the draw to select the cases should be conducted in a manner that does not leave out any genuine case.
It was decided that a letter from the Prime Minister should be sent to all beneficiaries.
Beneficiaries whose appeals have been approved for grant of relief, will be informed through an SMS alert.
Shri Narendra Modi also reviewed the functioning of the other Prime Minister’s funds, viz. the PM’s discretionary fund, the PM’s National Defence Fund, the PM’s fund for student’s aid, and the PM’s fund for folk art.
Shri Nripendra Misra, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, and Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, and other senior officials attended the meeting.
