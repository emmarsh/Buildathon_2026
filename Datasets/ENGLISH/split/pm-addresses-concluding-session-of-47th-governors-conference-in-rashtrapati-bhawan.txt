The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, addressed the concluding session of the 47th Governors’ Conference at Rashtrapati Bhavan today.
The Prime Minister said Governors occupy a unique high position, owing to their vast years of experience, and the prestigious nature of their post.
He said they can hence work as catalytic agents in the States, speeding up and improving processes without themselves becoming a part of them.
The Prime Minister noted that India is the only major economy across the world, which is moving ahead strongly despite the global economic crisis.
He said that with the world taking note of India, India is not a mute spectator to global developments, and has played a key role in recent global fora such as CoP-21, and WTO.
The Prime Minister stressed on the importance of cooperative federalism, which he said must be implemented in letter and spirit.
He said the Centre and States must work together as “Team India.”
He added that the spirit of cooperative federalism must also extend to cooperative, competitive federalism, with healthy competition for development among states.
The Prime Minister urged all Governors to think about some form of legacy which they would leave behind at the end of their terms, as their contribution to the States.
