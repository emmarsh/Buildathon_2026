The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the media persons on National Press Day.
“My greetings to all friends in the media on National Press Day.
I appreciate the hardwork of our media, especially the reporters and camerapersons, who tirelessly work on the ground and bring forth various news that shapes national as well as global discourse.
The role of the media in giving voice to the voiceless is commendable.
Over the last three years, the media has added great strength to ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ and effectively furthered the message of cleanliness.
In this day and age we are seeing the rise of social media and news being consumed through mobile phones.
I am sure these advancements will further the reach of the media and make the media space even more democratic and participative.
A free press is the cornerstone of a vibrant democracy.
We are fully committed to upholding freedom of press and expression in all forms.
May our media space be used more and more to showcase the skills, strengths and creativity of 125 crore Indians”, the Prime Minister said.
