The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for extension of the validity of the existing Central Orders dated 28.09.2015 in respect of edible oils and edible oilseeds and Central Order No.
S.O. No. 2857(E) dated 18.10.2015 in respect of pulses for a further period of one year from 01.10.2016 to 30.09.2017.
The main objective of the decision is to enable the State Governments to issue control orders with the prior concurrence of Central Government, for fixing stock limits/licensing requirements in respect of pulses, oilseeds and edible oils, whenever need is felt by them.
This is expected to help in the efforts being taken to improve the availability of these commodities to general public especially the vulnerable sections and control the tendencies of hoarding and profiteering.
Background:
Vide Central Government’s Order dated 15.2.2002, certain categories of foodstuffs were removed from the licensing, stock limits and movement restrictions.
From time to time thereafter, Government has been issuing notifications with the approval of the Cabinet, amending/keeping in abeyance the operation of the 2002 Order, whenever there is any abnormal price rise in any of the specified food commodities, for certain period.
Restrictions regarding pulses were first imposed in August 2006 and are extended from time to time.
Oils and oilseeds were added later in April, 2008 and the same were extended from time to time.
The validity of the current Order is expiring on 30.9.2016 seeking further extension considering the prevailing current situation.
