The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for providing State Government jobs and transit accommodations in the Kashmir Valley for the rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants involving a total estimated expenditure of Rs. 2000 crore.
Terrorist violence/ militancy in Jammu & Kashmir, particularly in its early phases, had led to large scale forced migration of members of the Kashmiri Pandit community along with some Sikh and Muslim families from the Kashmir Valley.
Presently there are about 62,000 registered Kashmiri migrant families residing in Jammu, Delhi, NCR and other parts of country.
The new proposal provides for additional 3000 state government jobs to the Kashmiri migrants with financial assistance from the Government of India and to construct transit accommodations in the Kashmir Valley for the Kashmiri migrants to whom state government jobs have been provided/ will be provided.
The financial implication I this respect would be borne by the Government of India.
Earlier in 2008, a Package of Rs. 1618.40 crore was announced to facilitate the return of the migrants to the Kashmir Valley.
Under this package, 3000 State government jobs were to be provided to the Kashmiri migrant with central funding, of whom 1963 jobs have already been provided and process for remaining is underway.
469 Transit accommodations have been constructed in the Kashmir Valley which have been allotted to the newly appointed migrant employees on sharing basis.
