PM visits Gujarat, launches Saurashtra Narmada Irrigation Project
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today unveiled a plaque to launch the Saurashtra Narmada Irrigation (SAUNI) Project at Sanosara in Gujarat.
The Prime Minister visited the AJI-3 dam site, and witnessed the release of water from the gates of the dam.
Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled that even as Chief Minister of Gujarat, it had always been his firm belief that water was most important for the farmer.
He said that the water table in the State had begun to rise.
Check dams have also been built in large numbers, he added.
The Prime Minister noted how the situation had changed even in Kutch, where even our jawans did not get enough water at one point of time.
The Prime Minister said he still remembered the time when he had first met lawmakers from Saurashtra, and discussed the SAUNI Project.
He said this is an initiative that should make every Gujarati proud.
Shri Narendra Modi also emphasized on the need for water conservation, and spoke about the various initiatives taken by the Union Government for the welfare of the farmers, such as crop insurance.
The Prime Minister explained how schemes such as Ujjwala for LPG gas connections, and LED bulb distribution are transforming the quality of life of the people.
