The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for creation of five posts of Additional Solicitors General, one each for the High Courts of Punjab & Haryana, Patna, Jharkhand, Karnataka and its Circuit Benches at Hubli-Dharwad & Gulbarga and Gujarat.
This decision will strengthen the litigation machinery to represent the Union of India (UOI) as a whole and specifically in the Punjab & Haryana High Court, Patna High Court, Jharkhand High Court at Ranchi, Karnataka High Court at Bangalore including its Circuit Benches and Gujarat High Court.
This will also help in conduct of litigation on behalf of UOI efficiently and effectively.
The creation of these posts will also facilitate transaction of business in accordance with procedures and thus enable assigning of functions to legally trained persons.
It will result in greater accountability of Government Departments to curb frivolous litigation and lessen the burden of Government cases in these Courts.
The proposal will also boost the morale of Government Department in following the rule of law and defending government policies and preventing high revenue pilferages.
