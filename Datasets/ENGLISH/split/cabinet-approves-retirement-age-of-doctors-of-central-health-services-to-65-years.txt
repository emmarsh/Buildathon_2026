The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for enhancement of the age of superannuation of (i) Non-Teaching and Public Health Specialists of Central Health Service from 62 years to 65 years and (ii) Doctors of General Duty Medical Officers (GDMOs) sub-cadre of Central Health Service (CHS) to 65 years.
The target group would be officers of Non-Teaching, Public Health and GDMO sub-cadres of CHS.
The decision would help in better patient care, proper academic activities in Medical colleges as also in effective implementation of National Health Programmes for delivery of health care services.
There is no financial implications as the vacant posts would have to be filled up quickly to ensure continuity of patient care.
Background:
• The age of superannuation in respect of all four sub-cadres of Central Health Service was 60 years prior to 2006.
• The age of superannuation of the three specialists sub-cadres (Teaching, Non-Teaching and Public Health), except GDMO sub cadre, was enhanced, with the approval of the Cabinet in its meeting held on 2.11.2006, from 60 to 62 years.
• The age of superannuation of teaching sub-cadre was further enhanced from 62 to 65 years with the approval of the Cabinet in its meeting held on 05.06.2008 in view of huge shortfall of teaching specialists.
