In a unique and perhaps unprecedented gesture, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted individually with over 60 athletes who will represent India at the forthcoming Rio Olympics.
The Prime Minister offered words of encouragement to each of them.
He also chatted informally with several athletes, who drew out their mobile phones for selfies with the Prime Minister.
Later in the day, the Prime Minister took to the social networking platform Twitter, to share his photographs with each player, with words of encouragement for each of them.
Several sportspersons appreciated this gesture of the Prime Minister, and responded by sharing their own selfies and photos with the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister has also been retweeting some of these tweets, including those of Boxer Manoj Kumar, and Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt.
