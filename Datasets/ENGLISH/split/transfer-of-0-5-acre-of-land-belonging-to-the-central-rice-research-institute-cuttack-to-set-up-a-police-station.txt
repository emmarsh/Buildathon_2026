Background:-
A police outpost has been functioning inside the campus of the CRRI, Cuttack since 1982.
The Government of Odisha has notified upgradation of this police outpost to that of a police station.
The proposed land, after transfer, will be used for construction, establishment and operation of the police station.
The new police station will be accessible from the Cuttack-Paradeep road.
Establishment of this station at Cuttack, adjacent to the CRRI, would strengthen the security of the Institute and its employees; and would also be beneficial to the people living in the area.
