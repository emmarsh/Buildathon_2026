Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has invited suggestions and inputs for `Mann Ki Baat` Radio Programme of February 2015.
“Was thinking about this month`s radio programme and thought…why not share `Mann Ki Baat` with students preparing for board and competitive exams.
I urge students, parents and teachers to share exam experiences that would inspire youngsters and even motivate them in exam preparation.
Like always, I will share some of your thoughts, inputs and anecdotes during the programme.
Do share them here. http://mygov.in/groupissue/inputs-for-mann-ki-baat-february-2015/show”, the Prime Minister said.
