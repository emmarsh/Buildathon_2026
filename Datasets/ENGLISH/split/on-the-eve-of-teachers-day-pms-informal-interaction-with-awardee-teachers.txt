PM: Teaching is a “jeevan dharm” – way of life.
It is not a profession or job.
PM: Teachers should be two steps ahead of time – anticipate change and prepare the new generation for it.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today informally interacted with about 350 awardee teachers at his residence, on the eve of Teachers’ Day.
In course of the conversation, the Prime Minister remarked that “teaching” is not a profession or job, but a way of life – “jeevan dharm.”
He said a teacher never retires, and always continues to endeavour to teach the new generation.
The teachers participated enthusiastically in the informal interaction, and expressed their views on various aspects of teaching, and what being a good teacher entails.
The Prime Minister said that if a society is to progress, its teachers must always be two steps ahead of time.
They need to understand changes happening across the world, and prepare the new generation accordingly by arousing curiosity in them, he added.
The Prime Minister remarked that when he became Chief Minister of Gujarat for the first time, he had two wishes: to meet his schoolfriends, and to meet all the teachers who had ever taught him.
He expressed satisfaction that he had been able to fulfil both these wishes.
The Prime Minister wished the teachers’ well in their endeavour to mould the new generation of India.
