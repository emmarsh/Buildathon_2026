• Increased access to affordable, assured and clean energy supply for all should be our primary goal.
It is a major economic opportunity for all countries.
• Let us make an ambitious and innovative effort to make renewable, especially solar energy, competitive with conventional energy.
In Gujarat, the canal-top project worked well and saved water, too.
• Pricing of carbon, especially in mature markets with universal availability of power, can stimulate shift to renewable energy.
• Let us increase our collective R&D efforts and collaboration; and, ensure dissemination to all countries.
For this, I would propose that we set up a global virtual centre for clean energy research and development, with adequate public funding, which will fund collaborative projects in diverse sources of clean energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc.
India and the United States have built an excellent virtual centre on a bilateral basis, with matching public and private funding.
We can select a team of outstanding experts to evaluate and judge research projects.
The results should be available to all countries.
• We should also discuss innovative funding models to ensure rapid expansion of renewable energy in decentralised manner in rural areas.
• In countries like India, there are vast opportunities for those wishing to invest in clean coal technology, since our dependence will not reduce very soon.
• Nuclear energy can still be a safe, reliable and clean source of energy.
It will be an important part of our mix.
• Energy efficiency is the best source of clean energy.
In India, for example, building energy efficiency and efficiency in areas such as buildings, household appliances and industrial goods is receiving strong attention.
I invite you to come and invest in this sector in India.
• I also believe that change in lifestyle and economy in consumption will be the most enduring response to energy challenges.
• G20 can be effective in promoting an integrated the natural gas market, ensuring freer trade in gas and ensuring that the markets operate more efficiently.
