Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today urged both greater awareness, and greater pride, in India’s heritage.
He was speaking after releasing a book “Early Hindu Temples of Gujarat,” by Varun Maira, in New Delhi.
He said efforts such as this book would help us rediscover this heritage.
The Prime Minister said heritage and history go together, and heritage buildings are not just stone, but “living history.”
The Union MoS(I/C) for culture, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, was present on the occasion.
