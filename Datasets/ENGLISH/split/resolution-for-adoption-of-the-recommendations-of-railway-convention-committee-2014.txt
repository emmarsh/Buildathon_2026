The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to move a Resolution in both the Houses of Parliament for adoption of the recommendations of the Railway Convention Committee (2014)’s recommendations that for the year 2014-15 and 2015-16, the rate of dividend to the General Revenue be determined at 5% and 4% respectively on the entire capital (excluding dividend free capital) invested in Railways from the General Revenues.
This would enable the Ministry of Railways to implement the recommendations contained in Para Nos. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Railway Convention Committee (2014)’s first report.
