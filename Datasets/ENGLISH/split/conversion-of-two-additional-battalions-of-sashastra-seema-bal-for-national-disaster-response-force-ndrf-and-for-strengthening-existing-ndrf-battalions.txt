The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for the conversion of two additional battalions of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) for the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and for strengthening existing NDRF battalions.
The objective of the conversion of these two additional battalions of SSB into NDRF battalions is to provide response to the area of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh during any natural and manmade disaster and to enhance the capability of the existing NDRF battalions.
The placement of two NDRF Battalions at Varanasi and Arunachal Pradesh will fill up the vast gap of deployment of the NDRF.
