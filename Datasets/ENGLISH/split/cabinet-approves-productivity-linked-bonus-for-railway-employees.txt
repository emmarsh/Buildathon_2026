The Productivity Linked Bonus on Railway covers all non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) who are spread over the entire country.
Payment of PLB to eligible railway employees is made each year before the Dusshera/ Puja holidays.
The decision of the Cabinet shall be implemented before the holidays for this year as well.
For the year 2017-18 PLB equivalent to 78 days’ wages will be paid which is expected to motivate the employees for working towards improving the performance of the Railways.
Background:
Railways were the first departmental undertaking of the Government of India wherein the concept of PLB was introduced in the year 1979-80.
The main consideration at that time was the important role of the Railways as an infrastructural support in the performance of the economy as a whole.
In the overall context of Railway working, it was considered desirable to introduce the concept of PLB as against the concept of Bonus on the lines of ‘The Payment of Bonus Act – 1965’.
