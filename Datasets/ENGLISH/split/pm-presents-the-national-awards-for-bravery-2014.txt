The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the National Awards for Bravery, 2014 to 24 children.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the brave deeds done by these children are proof that God has kept in each one of us, an element that inspires us all to live for others.
He said not everyone gets a chance to die for others, but everyone has a chance to live for others.
However, there are very few who are actually able to accomplish this.
Commending the children for their brave and selfless acts, the Prime Minister said that they had shown courage in the face of adversity, without bothering about the consequences.
He said the “biggest beauty” of the deeds performed by the brave children, was that, when faced with a certain situation, they could not stop themselves from acting with courage.
He said that in the process, they had inspired others in society.
The Prime Minister said that for these children, the greater responsibility begins now.
Speaking to the children, he said that fame and success can be slippery, and therefore they will have to keep their composure.
He urged the children to work towards their goals and dreams relentlessly, (bina thake, bina ruke, bina jhuke).
The Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Gandhi, was present on the occasion.
The National Bravery Award Scheme was initiated by the ICCW to give due recognition to the children who distinguish themselves by performing outstanding deeds of bravery and meritorious service and to inspire other children to emulate their examples.
