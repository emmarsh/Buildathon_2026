The Prime Minister today presented President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj a specially commissioned reproduction of a rare 13th century manuscript on the history of Mongols from the Rampur Raza Library, Rampur.
Called Jamiut Tawarikh, this work was one of the grandest projects undertaken by the Ilkhanate king Ghazan Khan (1295-1304) and was done by the king’s wazir Rasheeduddin Fazlullah Hamedani who wrote it in Persian and chronicled the history up to the reign of Oljeitju (1304-1316).
The breadth of coverage of the work often caused it to be dubbed as the first world history.
The manuscript has over 80 fine miniature illustrations.
The manuscript is a part of Volume 1 of the work and no other copy of it is known to exist.
