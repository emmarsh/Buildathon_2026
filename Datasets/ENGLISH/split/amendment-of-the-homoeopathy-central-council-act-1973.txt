The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for the amendment of the Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973.
This amendment in the Act, will make provisions relating to granting permission by Central Government to all homoeopathic medical colleges for continuing course/courses, so as to ensure that homoeopathy education is given only through colleges which can impart quality education.
The Central Government permission to undertake annual admissions is being made mandatory for all the homoeopathy colleges and also the provision to give permission for five years to colleges which conform, to the prescribed standards, has been incorporated.
This amendment will ensure quality homoeopathy education leading to better healthcare through the homeopathy system of medicine.
Background:
The existing provisions in the Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973 are not enabling the Central Government to stop admissions in existing colleges, which are not conforming to standards specified in the regulations made under the Act.
Due to this, the quality of homoeopathy education is being compromised.
The amendment shall therefore, improve standards of existing colleges to the prescribed levels and ensure similar standards of infrastructure, facilities and manpower in existing homoeopathic colleges as would be required for new colleges.
