The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today planted a Kadamb sapling (Neolamarckia Cadamba), at the Race Course Road lawns, to mark the occasion of World Environment Day.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister exhorted each family to plant trees in the coming monsoon season, and to take pride in the number of trees planted by the family, just the same way as they take pride in worldly possessions.
The Prime Minister said that living in harmony with nature is the only way to avoid a catastrophic situation on Mother Earth.
The Prime Minister also placed a traditional earthen-pot (matka) along with the sapling, which is a traditional way of conserving water, and ensuring that the sapling has regular water supply.
Planting the Kadamb sapling, the Prime Minister recalled the poem of Subhadra Kumari Chauhan, on the subject:
यह कदंब का पेड़ अगर माँ होता यमुना तीरे। मैं भी उस पर बैठ कन्हैया बनता धीरे-धीरे।।
The Union Minister for Environment and Forests, Shri Prakash Javadekar, was present on the occasion.
