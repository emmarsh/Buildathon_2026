Prime Minister has approved the constitution of a Committee to carry out a review to identify obsolete laws.
The newly-constituted Committee will examine all Acts recommended to be repealed by the Committee on Review of Administrative Laws, which had been appointed by the Union Government of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 1998.
The Prime Minister has expressed concern that out of the 1382 Acts recommended for repeal by that Committee, only 415 have been repealed so far.
He has called for a focused and result-oriented exercise to systematically weed out archaic laws and rules.
The Committee will also examine Acts and Rules which may have become obsolete within the last ten to fifteen years.
The Committee will be chaired by Shri R. Ramanujam, Secretary PMO.
Shri V. K. Bhasin, former Secretary, Legislative Department, will be its other member.
The Committee will submit its report within three months, so that a comprehensive Bill can be introduced in the Winter Session of Parliament, based on its recommendations.
