On World Health Day, I pray that all of you remain in the best of health and at the same time inspire others to lead a healthy life.
Theme of this year’s World Health Day, Food Safety is an essential pre-condition for good health and we all must focus on it.
Govt is working tirelessly to realise the dream of a Healthy India where every citizen has access to proper and affordable healthcare.
