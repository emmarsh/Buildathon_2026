PM exhorts IAS probationers to recall Mahatma’s talisman
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with 181 IAS probationers of the 2015 batch.
The Prime Minister exhorted the IAS probationers to recall Mahatma Gandhi’s talisman of keeping in mind the welfare of the poorest of the poor, while taking decisions.
Noting that several of the probationers had worked in the private sector before joining the IAS, he said that while their earlier assignments were “jobs”, they are now going to undertake “service.”
Stressing the importance of progress and connectivity in the North-East, the Prime Minister said that if the North-East developed, the entire country would march forward.
In response to a question, Shri Narendra Modi said that his extensive travels across India for over four decades, and his experience as Chief Minister of a State, had helped him in his work as Prime Minister.
