The President of Asian Development Bank, Mr. Takehiko Nakao, called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today.
The Prime Minister urged Mr. Nakao that the Asian Development Bank should take up the Railways sector in India as a priority, and complete one transformational project which will create a visible impact.
He suggested that the ADB could take up one railway station and make it world class.
The Railways can then follow this up with other similar projects.
The Prime Minister said ADB should foster more regional connectivity projects.
The Prime Minister complimented Mr. Nakao on achieving a disbursement of US$ 1.4 billion in 2014, which is 40 percent more than the 2013 achievement for projects in India.
The Prime Minister also mentioned the various initiatives that have been taken by the Government, since his last meeting with Mr. Nakao in August 2014.
These include the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, cash transfers in LPG subsidy, and the launch of initiatives such as Make in India, Digital India, and Swachh Bharat.
The President of the ADB complimented the Prime Minister on these initiatives.
