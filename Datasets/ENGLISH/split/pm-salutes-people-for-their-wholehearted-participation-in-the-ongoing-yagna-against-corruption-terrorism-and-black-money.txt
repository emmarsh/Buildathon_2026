The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has saluted the people of India for wholeheartedly participating in the ongoing Yagna against corruption, terrorism and black money.
In a series of tweets, speaking about the benefits of the demonetization decision of the government, the Prime Minister has also urged the people to embrace increased cashless payments and integrate latest technology in their economic transactions.
“I salute the people of India for wholeheartedly participating in this ongoing Yagna against corruption, terrorism and black money.
The Government’s decision has several gains for farmers, traders, labourers, who are the economic backbone of our nation.
I always said that the Government’s measure will bring a degree of inconvenience but this short term pain will pave way for long term gains.
No longer will the progress and prosperity of rural India be curtailed by corruption and black money.
Our villages must get their due.
We also have a historic opportunity to embrace increased cashless payments and integrate latest technology in economic transactions.
My young friends, you are agents of change who will make India corruption free and ensure more cashless transactions.
Together, we must ensure #IndiaDefeatsBlackMoney.
This will empower the poor, neo-middle class, middle class & benefit future generations”, the Prime Minister said.
