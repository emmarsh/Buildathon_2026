Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said that the postal network can become a driving force for the Indian Economy, just like the Indian Railways.
His remarks came during the presentation of a report by the task force on leveraging the post office network.
The Prime Minister, after an initial discussion on various aspects of the report, has directed that the recommendations of the task force be studied in detail within a short period of time, so that necessary follow-up action can be initiated.
The Prime Minister said the postman, along with the teacher, is the most respected Government employee in rural areas.
The Prime Minister said the Department of Posts has huge assets across India, and ways should be explored to suitably use these assets for the benefit of the people.
He said post offices in rural areas can be used to deliver services and important government information to individual households.
The Minister for Communication and IT, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, was present on the occasion.
The presentation on behalf of the task force was given by its Chairman, Shri T. S. R. Subramanian.
