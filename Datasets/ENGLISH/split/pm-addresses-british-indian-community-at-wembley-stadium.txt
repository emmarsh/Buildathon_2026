PM: India is recognised today as a land of power and possibilities.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said India’s immense diversity is its speciality, pride and strength.
Addressing a massive gathering of the British-Indian Community at the Wembley Stadium in London, in the presence of UK Prime Minister David Cameron, the Prime Minister spoke of the great contributions of the Sikh community and of India’s Sufi tradition.
He recalled his meeting with the Sikh community in London yesterday, and said he shared their pain, understood their problems and was working to resolve them.
Expounding his vision of India, in his speech which lasted more than one hour, the Prime Minister recalled Imran Khan of Alwar, Rajasthan, who has made about 50 education apps and distributed them free.
He also recalled a Sarpanch in Haryana, who had responded to his Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao call, with a “Selfie with Daughter” campaign, which eventually became a global success.
He said he was sure of India’s bright future because his vision of India, was the India of Imran Khan who created and gave education apps for free; and of the Sarpanch who had conceived Selfie with India.
He said there are countless such people in India.
The Prime Minister said all major religions of the world are present in India, and in big numbers too.
He said the Indian diaspora carries these values with it wherever they go, and hence they are great ambassadors for India.
The Prime Minister spoke of his Government’s initiatives so far, and of his plans especially on Swachh Bharat and Clean Energy, to transform the lives of India’s citizens.
He said India would lead a global “Solar Alliance” of countries blessed with abundant solar radiation, to pursue the goal of economical solar energy generation.
India is much bigger and far greater than what you see on TV screens and newspaper headlines, the Prime Minister said.
