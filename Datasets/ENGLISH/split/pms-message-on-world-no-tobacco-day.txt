Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has given the following message on World No Tobacco Day:
“World No Tobacco Day reminds us of the harms associated with tobacco consumption and a day to reaffirm our commitment to reduce this menace.
The World Health Organization’s focus on stopping illicit trade of tobacco products is a laudatory effort that will help in minimising tobacco consumption.”
