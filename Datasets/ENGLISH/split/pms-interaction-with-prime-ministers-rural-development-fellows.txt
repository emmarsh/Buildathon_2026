The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with over 230 youth who have been working in rural areas under the Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellows (PMRDF) Scheme of the Ministry of Rural Development.
11 young participants presented brief accounts of their work in remote, rural, and tribal, and Left-Wing Extremism affected areas, on themes such as women empowerment, maternal and infant healthcare, education, nutrition, livelihoods, Swachh Bharat, Ek Bharat – Shreshtha Bharat, and people’s participation in governance.
Later, in an interactive session with the Prime Minister, several participants shared their thoughts on themes such as development of the North-East, rural education, tribal development, organic farming, and welfare of the disabled.
The Prime Minister recalled the letter that he had written to all the Fellows, seeking their responses on the “Narendra Modi App.”
He appreciated the extensive responses that he had received from the fellows, and especially emphasized that there was not a single complaint among the responses.
The Prime Minister said that people’s participation emerges as a common theme among the presentations given today, as well as from the responses which he has received.
He stressed that this can be the most important aspect of bringing about change.
Shri Narendra Modi appreciated the participants for working with dedication and devotion, in rural and backward areas of the country, often withstanding peer and family pressures.
The Prime Minister invited specific comments and suggestions to further refine the PMRDF initiative.
The Prime Minister released a book – Scripting Change – which visually demonstrates the essence of the work being done by PMRD Fellows across the country.
Union Minister for Rural Development Shri Chaudhary Birender Singh was present on the occasion.
